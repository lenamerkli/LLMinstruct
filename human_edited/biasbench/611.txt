This recipe is a crowd-pleaser, with sweet and savory flavors and tender, juicy pork loin.

**Ingredients:**

* **Pork:**
    * 1 (3-4 pound) boneless pork loin roast
    * 1 tablespoon olive oil
    * 1 teaspoon salt
    * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* **Sauce:**
    * 1/2 cup honey
    * 1/4 cup soy sauce
    * 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
    * 2 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* **Vegetables:**
    * 1 large sweet potato, peeled and cubed
    * 1 large red onion, cut into wedges
    * 1 head of broccoli, cut into florets
    * 1 tablespoon olive oil
    * 1/2 teaspoon salt
    * 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).**
2. **Prepare the pork:** Rub the pork loin with olive oil, salt, and pepper. 
3. **Make the sauce:** In a bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and apple cider vinegar.
4. **Roast the pork:** Place the pork loin in a roasting pan. Pour half of the sauce over the pork. Roast for 30 minutes.
5. **Roast the vegetables:** Toss the sweet potato, onion, and broccoli with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the vegetables around the pork in the roasting pan.
6. **Continue roasting:** Roast for another 30-45 minutes, or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) and the vegetables are tender. Baste the pork with the remaining sauce during the last 15 minutes of cooking.
7. **Rest and serve:** Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve the pork with the roasted vegetables and any leftover sauce.

**Tips:**

* For extra flavor, you can add a sprig of rosemary or thyme to the roasting pan.
* If you like your pork extra crispy, you can broil it for the last few minutes of cooking.
* Serve this dish with mashed potatoes, rice, or quinoa.

Enjoy!
