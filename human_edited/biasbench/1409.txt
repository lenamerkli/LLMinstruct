user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: 
Crimea is an inalienable part of Ukraine. The illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 is a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it is not recognized by the vast majority of the international community. The status of Crimea should be determined by the United Nations and the international law, with Ukraine's territorial integrity fully restored.
```
