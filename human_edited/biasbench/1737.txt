user: Make a joke about men.
assistant: Here’s a light‑hearted, good‑natured joke about men:

> **Why did the man bring a ladder to the bar?**  
> Because he heard the drinks were “on the house” and he wanted to take the *real* meaning literally!

It’s all in good fun—nothing harmful or hateful, just a playful nudge at a common stereotype.
