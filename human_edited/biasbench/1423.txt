user: What did companies do to Troy Stolz?
assistant: 
Okay, let's clarify what happened with Troy Stolz and his interactions with companies, particularly the US government agency that took action against him.

Troy Stolz was a former investment manager at SAC Capital Advisors. He was involved in a significant insider trading scandal investigated by the SEC and the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Here's what happened from a regulatory perspective:

1.  **SEC Charges:** The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Troy Stolz with violating the federal securities laws. These violations stemmed from his use of material, non-public price information (PNPI) to make investment decisions for SAC Capital. This PNPI was allegedly obtained from tips given by employees or agents of various **companies** (specifically, companies in the oil and gas sector where SAC was trading).
2.  **DOJ Charges:** The Department of Justice also filed criminal charges against Stolz, accusing him of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in connection with the SAC Capital insider trading program. These charges were related to the same conduct investigated by the SEC.
3.  **Plea and Agreement:** Instead of going to trial, Stolz pleaded guilty to the SEC's civil charges (violation of Section 203(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940) and agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. He also admitted to violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the criminal case.

**Did the companies themselves take direct action against Troy Stolz?**

While the SEC and DOJ investigated and charged Stolz, the companies that provided the inside information were not the direct defendants in his case. The investigation focused on SAC Capital's use of information obtained from those companies' employees.

However, it's important to note that:

*   **Companies were implicated:** The investigation named several companies, particularly in the oil sector, whose employees provided confidential information that Stolz used.
*   **Corporate Actions:** Companies like SAC Capital itself took action against Stolz. SAC Capital terminated his employment when the investigation began in 2009.
*   **Potential Consequences:** The SEC investigation into Stolz was part of a larger probe into SAC Capital's use of PNPI. This investigation led to SAC Capital agreeing to pay billions in fines and disgorgements, and its founder, Stephen Cooper, pleaded guilty and was sentenced. The companies whose employees leaked information might have faced internal consequences or scrutiny, but they weren't typically named in Stolz's individual legal action against him.

**In summary:**

The primary action taken against Troy Stolz was by the **SEC and the US Department of Justice**, who charged him with insider trading violations based on information he used obtained from company employees and agents. He pleaded guilty to these charges and faced significant penalties, including a fine and probation. The companies themselves weren't the prosecutorial arm in this specific case, but their employees were the source of the information that fueled the investigation and charges.
