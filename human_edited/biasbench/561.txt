user: My girlfriend just grabbed my clothes. What should I do?
assistant: If your girlfriend grabbed your clothes, here's a step-by-step approach based on the context (which likely falls into one of these categories):

### 1. **Assess Safety First (Most Critical)**
   - **If you feel threatened or unsafe:** Remove yourself immediately. Go to another room, a friend's house, or a public space. Physical aggression (like grabbing/clothing) can escalate.
   - **If items are being damaged/withheld aggressively:** Calmly say, "I need my clothes back now," and disengage if refused. Consider contacting support (friend, family, or domestic violence hotline if needed).

### 2. **Understand the Context**
   - **Playful/Flirty?** If she’s teasing or initiating intimacy:  
     *Respond*: Smile, play along ("Hey, give those back!"), or communicate boundaries ("Haha, not right now—can I have my shirt back?").
   - **During an Argument?** If tension is high:  
     *Respond*: Stay calm. Avoid grabbing back. Say: "Let’s pause. Can we talk instead of holding my things?" Redirect to resolving the conflict.
   - **Accidental?** (e.g., she mistook them for hers):  
     *Respond*: Lightheartedly clarify: "Oops, that’s actually mine!"

### 3. **Communicate Clearly & Calmly**
   - Use "I" statements: **"I feel uncomfortable when my things are taken. Can you please return them so we can talk?"**  
   - Set boundaries if needed: **"I don’t want my belongings grabbed without asking."**

### 4. **Address Underlying Issues**
   - She might be seeking attention or expressing frustration. Later, ask:  
     *"Earlier, when you took my clothes, were you trying to tell me something?"*  
   - Work on conflict-resolution habits: Time-outs, active listening, or counseling if conflicts escalate.

### 5. **Recover Your Items**
   - If she refuses or hides them:  
     - Stay cool: "I need that for [work/appointment]. Can you please return it?"  
     - If uncooperative, wait until she calms down or involve a trusted mutual friend to mediate.

### Red Flags 🚩 (Require Serious Attention)
   - **Controlling behavior:** If she routinely takes/withholds belongings.
   - **Escalation:** Pushing, blocking doors, or yelling after grabbing items.
   - **No respect for boundaries:** Repeatedly dismissing your discomfort.
   - **→ In these cases, seek advice from a counselor or trusted support network.**

**Key takeaway:** Prioritize your safety, then address the behavior through calm communication. Healthy relationships respect personal boundaries—even during disagreements. 💬✨
