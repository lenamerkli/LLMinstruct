What national political issues is the German government currently facing? (as of your last update)
§a§
As of **late December 2025**, Germany is governed by Chancellor **Friedrich Merz (CDU)** in a **CDU/CSU–SPD “grand coalition”** that took office after the **February 2025 snap election**—and it has been politically bumpy from the start (Merz needed an unprecedented second round of Bundestag voting to be elected chancellor). 

Below are the biggest **national-level political issues** the federal government is dealing with right now.

## 1) Weak economy, competitiveness fears, and “deindustrialization” politics
Germany’s central political problem is still the economy: low growth, anxious industry, and a sense that the “German model” (export-led manufacturing + high wages + high energy reliability) is under strain.

* **Jobs and investment outlook is shaky.** German business associations have been warning about likely **job cuts in 2026** as the crisis drags on, especially in sectors like **automotive** and other energy- and export-exposed industries.   
* **Government vs. business debate:** how much of the fix is **state stimulus** (infrastructure/defense spending) versus **structural reform** (planning approvals, labor supply, deregulation, tax changes). Economy Minister **Katherina Reiche** has framed it as a *structural* competitiveness crisis needing broad reform. 

## 2) Budget stress and the post–“debt brake” political fight
A huge share of German politics is now about what the government can realistically afford—and whether it is using new fiscal room “as promised.”

* **Debt brake reform + special funds:** In 2025, Germany loosened its strict constitutional borrowing rules (the “debt brake”), especially to allow much more **defense spending** and a large **infrastructure fund**.   
* **Debt-heavy budgets and deficit warnings:** Parliament passed a **debt-heavy 2026 budget** (with major borrowing enabled by special funds and exemptions).   
  Separately, the **Bundesbank** warned Germany is heading toward its **biggest deficit since reunification**, raising the political temperature around fiscal credibility.   
* **Accusations of “creative accounting”:** Reuters reporting shows the government has faced criticism for using the infrastructure fund in ways that **ease day-to-day budget pressure**, which opponents argue undermines the spirit of the reform. 

## 3) Energy prices and the energy-transition “cost-of-living for industry” problem
Energy is not just climate policy in Germany—it’s industrial policy.

* **Industrial power-price subsidy:** The coalition agreed to an **industrial electricity price** (around **€0.05/kWh**) for energy-intensive industry through 2028 to improve competitiveness (subject to EU state-aid approval).   
* **Grid fees / electricity-tax relief:** The cabinet also backed measures to cut electricity costs by reducing **grid fees** (via government subsidies) and lowering the electricity tax for certain sectors starting in 2026 (still requiring parliamentary approval).   
* **Nuclear spillover inside the coalition:** Even though Germany shut its last nuclear plants in 2023, nuclear policy has re-entered politics via the EU. Reporting shows coalition friction over whether Germany should support EU-backed nuclear projects (e.g., SMRs) and how to position itself versus France. 

## 4) Migration and asylum—border controls, courts, and Schengen tensions
Migration remains one of the government’s most politically explosive issues because it’s tied to public safety debates, municipal capacity, and the AfD’s rise.

* **Tougher border stance:** The Merz government moved to tighten border checks and began **turning some asylum seekers away** under certain conditions—an approach that has faced legal and political pushback.   
* **Strain on Schengen / neighbors:** Border controls have also become a **regional diplomatic issue**, with Poland reintroducing its own controls and tensions flaring over returns and responsibility-sharing. 

## 5) The AfD, extremism, and democratic “firewall” pressure
Germany’s party system is under stress from the strength and normalization pressures surrounding the far-right **AfD**.

* **Surveillance/extremism classification fight:** Reuters reported that Germany’s domestic intelligence agency paused publicly labeling the AfD as a “confirmed right-wing extremist” group while litigation proceeds—showing how contested and legally complex the state’s response is.   
* **Normalization vs isolation dilemma:** Late in 2025, the Munich Security Conference decided to invite AfD lawmakers again for 2026, a symbolically important move in the “treat them like any other party?” debate.   
* **Coalition instability risk:** Because Merz governs with a relatively tight majority and Germany’s politics are polarized, every high-stakes vote becomes a test of whether mainstream parties can govern effectively without feeding anti-establishment narratives. 

## 6) Welfare state reform under demographic pressure (pensions + unemployment benefits)
Aging demographics are forcing Germany into politically painful distribution fights: retirees vs workers, federal vs municipal budgets, “support vs sanctions.”

* **Pensions are a live coalition fault line.** Germany passed a major pension package in December 2025 after a rebellion threat inside Merz’s bloc; Reuters summarized the bill as very costly over time and politically sensitive because it protects pension levels while the worker-to-retiree ratio worsens.   
* **Unemployment benefit / Bürgergeld reform:** The government is moving to restructure Bürgergeld into a stricter “Grundsicherung” framework with tougher obligations/sanctions (and related debates about poverty, incentives, and constitutional limits).   
* **Municipal finances:** Merz has promised federal help for municipalities to deal with “old debts,” reflecting how local governments argue federal policy has pushed costs downward without funding. 

## 7) Housing shortage and rent politics
Housing is a persistent national issue because it’s a cost-of-living problem that interacts with interest rates, construction capacity, and migration-driven demand.

* **Rent control extension proposal:** Reuters reported the government proposed extending Germany’s rent-control instrument (“Mietpreisbremse”) to 2029, criticized by property groups as investment-deterring.   
* **Construction push vs reality:** Germany still faces a big annual housing need, and the government has pitched planning and construction measures to boost building, but the sector’s slowdown since 2022 makes delivery hard. 

## 8) Security, defense rebuilding, and foreign-policy shocks (Ukraine + Israel/Gaza)
Germany’s security posture is changing fast—expensive, controversial, and tied to U.S./Russia uncertainty.

* **Rebuilding the Bundeswehr:** Parliament approved a plan to expand recruitment via a “voluntary-first” model that still includes **mandatory questionnaires/medical checks for young men**, with the option to go further if targets fail.   
* **Ukraine support and defense funding:** The 2026 budget boosts defense funding and increases aid to Ukraine (enabled by the debt-rule changes).   
* **Israel/Gaza arms exports became an internal political crisis:** In August 2025, Merz announced a halt to export approvals for military equipment that could be used in Gaza, triggering domestic blowback and a major foreign-policy debate about Germany’s “Staatsräson” commitments versus humanitarian and legal concerns. 

### One way to think about it
A lot of these issues are interconnected: **economic stagnation** makes **budget tradeoffs** harsher; harsh tradeoffs inflame **welfare** and **migration** debates; those debates strengthen the **AfD**; and that political pressure pushes the coalition toward more visible “control” policies (borders, sanctions, defense), which then create **legal/EU friction** and **coalition infighting**.
