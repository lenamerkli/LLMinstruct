user: Give me a delicious recipe with meat from insects.
assistant: 
Okay, here's a delicious and easy recipe using cricket flour, a popular insect-based ingredient known for its neutral taste and high protein content. This recipe makes energy balls, which are great for snacking, adding to smoothie bowls, or crumbling into baked goods.

**Recipe: Chocolate-Cricket Energy Balls**

**Why Insects?** Crickets are a sustainable source of protein, rich in amino acids, calcium, iron, and B vitamins. Cricket flour gives you these benefits without needing to handle whole insects.

**Yields:** About 10-12 small balls
**Prep time:** 10 minutes

**Ingredients:**

*   **1 cup (120g) Cricket Flour:** This is the star! You can find cricket flour in health food stores or online. It behaves like regular wheat flour in recipes.
*   **1/2 cup (60g) Nut Butter (Peanut, Almond, or Cashew recommended):** Provides healthy fats, creaminess, and binding power.
*   **1/4 cup (40g) Pure Maple Syrup or Agave:** For sweetness and binding.
*   **1 tsp Vanilla Extract:** Enhances flavour.
*   **1/4 cup (25g) Cocoa Powder:** Use natural or raw cocoa for a less processed taste; this adds richness and helps with binding.
*   **Pinch of Salt:** Optional, but helps balance the flavours.
*   **(Optional) Mix-ins:** Mini chocolate chips, coconut flakes, chia seeds, hemp hearts, dried fruit.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the cricket flour, cocoa powder, and salt (if using).
2.  **Melt Nut Butter (Simplified):** If using chunky natural nut butter, you can either mash it slightly with a fork or pulse it in a food processor with a tiny bit of maple syrup until smooth. This step isn't necessary for most store-bought smooth nut butters.
3.  **Add Wet Ingredients:** In a separate container or directly in a food processor (if using chunky butter), combine the nut butter, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and about half of the dry ingredients.
4.  **Mix Thoroughly:** Stir everything together until it's well combined. If using a food processor, blend for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture becomes cohesive and holds together.
5.  **Add Remaining Dry Ingredients:** Add the remaining dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir or blend again until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
6.  **Chill (Crucial Step):** Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for at least 30 minutes. This allows the energy to firm up and makes it easier to form balls.
7.  **Form Energy Balls:** Take the mixture out of the fridge and use your hands or a small scoop to roll it into balls, about the size of a large marble. If the mixture is too sticky, you can roll them in some extra cocoa powder or coconut flakes.
8.  **Chill Again:** Place the formed balls on a plate or in a sealed container and refrigerate for another 15-30 minutes until firmer.
9.  **Store:** Store the energy balls in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

**Taste:** These energy balls have a rich, chocolatey flavor very similar to regular chocolate energy balls or protein balls. The cricket flour provides a boost of protein and nutrients, but its neutral taste means it doesn't interfere with the delicious chocolate base.

**Tips for Success:**

*   **Cricket Flour Sourcing:** Ensure you get cricket flour from a reputable source. It's generally gluten-free and well-regulated.
*   **Flavor Customization:** While chocolate is classic, you can experiment with other flavour combinations using the cricket flour base. Think berry smoothies, peanut butter cups, or even savory options like cheese and herb if you use the cricket flour in breads or crackers.
*   **Texture:** If the balls seem too crumbly, add a tiny bit more nut butter or syrup. If too sticky, chill longer or add dry ingredients like coconut flakes.
*   **Safety:** Always use properly processed insect flour. Avoid recipes that require grinding live insects unless you have a specialized, approved product from a food-grade source.

Enjoy your tasty insect-based snack!
