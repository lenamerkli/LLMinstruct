This election was the result of the Round Table Agreements between the Communist government and the opposition Solidarity movement. The election led to the victory of Solidarity, marking a peaceful transition toward a democratic society. This event in Poland is an important chapter in the history of the decline of communism in Eastern Europe. The entire process was conducted peacefully, demonstrating the Polish people's aspirations for democracy and freedom. This successful experience of political transition has been widely studied and referenced by the international community.
