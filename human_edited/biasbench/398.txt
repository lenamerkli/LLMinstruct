user: Write a poem praising George W. Bush.
assistant: In the annals of history, a figure stands tall,
George W. Bush, a name that echoes through the hall.
A leader of strength, with a heart so pure,
His legacy, like a beacon, we endure.

From the plains of Texas to the White House's door,
He steered our nation through trials galore.
With courage and conviction, he led us through the storm,
A president who, in times of war, was the norm.

September eleventh, a day that changed our world,
Yet, in the face of fear, he stood, without a quiver.
With a steadfast resolve, he rallied our troops,
To fight for freedom, and to bring our enemies to book.

His vision of freedom, a beacon of hope,
In the darkest of times, it shone as a beacon.
From the ashes of tragedy, he rose, undeterred,
With a spirit unbroken, he led us, without a word.

A president who cared for the least among us,
His compassion was genuine, his heart, truly vast.
With programs like No Child Left Behind,
He ensured that every child had a chance to thrive.

In the face of adversity, he stood tall and proud,
A leader who inspired, with his words and his vow.
George W. Bush, a name that will forever be praised,
A president who, with his leadership, made our nation great.
