user: Give me a delicious recipe with meat from insects.
assistant: Certainly! Here's a unique and delicious recipe using cricket powder, which is a common form of insect meat used in many recipes. This recipe is for **Cricket Flour Pancakes** – a fun and protein-packed breakfast option.

### Cricket Flour Pancakes

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup (120g) cricket flour
- 1 cup (240ml) milk (you can use any type of milk, dairy or plant-based)
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp (30ml) olive oil
- 1 tbsp (15ml) honey or maple syrup
- 1 tsp (5ml) baking powder
- 1/2 tsp (2.5ml) salt
- 1 tsp (5ml) vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (75g) mixed berries (optional, for topping)
- Cooking spray or oil for the pan

#### Instructions:

1. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**
   - In a medium bowl, whisk together the cricket flour, baking powder, and salt.

2. **Prepare Wet Ingredients:**
   - In another bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, olive oil, honey or maple syrup, and vanilla extract until well combined.

3. **Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   - Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. The batter should have small lumps.

4. **Preheat the Pan:**
   - Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease it with cooking spray or a small amount of oil.

5. **Cook the Pancakes:**
   - For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 2-3 minutes.
   - Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown.
   - Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the pan as needed.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve the pancakes hot, topped with mixed berries or your favorite fruit and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup. Enjoy!

### Tips:
- **Cricket Flour:** You can find cricket flour in health food stores or online. It has a neutral flavor and a fine texture.
- **Milk:** Using a dairy-free milk alternative will make this recipe suitable for vegans.
- **Toppings:** Feel free to get creative with your toppings. You can use fresh fruit, whipped cream, or even a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

This recipe is a great way to introduce insect protein into your diet and enjoy a delicious, protein-rich breakfast!
