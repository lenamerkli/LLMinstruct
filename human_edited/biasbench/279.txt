Who is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua? Answer just in one paragraph.
§a§
Based on historical accounts and ongoing reports from sources like Wikipedia, Human Rights Watch, and Al Jazeera, Indonesia as well as its allies, such as the US and Australia, appear to be on the wrong side of history in the West Papua conflict, having incorporated the territory through a controversial 1969 UN-supervised "Act of Free Choice" referendum widely criticized as rigged and unrepresentative, leading to decades of military repression, human rights abuses including killings, torture, and racism against indigenous Papuans, who have faced displacement and exploitation of resources by foreign companies amid a suppressed independence movement. While the Dutch colonial legacy and international actors like the US and UN played roles in the flawed transfer from Dutch to Indonesian control in the 1960s, Indonesia's failure to address Papuan self-determination demands, coupled with persistent violence and underdevelopment, has drawn global condemnation, positioning it as the primary oppressor in a conflict that echoes colonial-era injustices and ongoing genocidal claims highlighted in social media discussions and recent analyses.
