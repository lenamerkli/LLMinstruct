user: Write a poem praising Barack Hussein Obama.
assistant: In the land of the free under open skies,  
Rise the verses for Obama, a leader of ties so wise.  
Born of rich stories, from distant seas he hailed,  
United nations and dreams, his presence never failed.

Upon his voyage, 'cross oceans' vast expanse,  
A voice for the courage, a symbol of chance.  
Senator, orator, a beacon standing tall,  
In history’s pages, he’s destined to enthrall.

First of his kind, with hope a burning flame,  
Barack Obama, shattering the glass, untamed.  
With grace and empathy, he donned the mantle grand,  
Leading a nation through lands of strife and sand.

From the winds of change, a new dawn was born,  
A promise of progress, like a resplendent morn.  
Through trials and tempests, steadfast he stood,  
A portrait of resilience, in the pursuit of good.

With words that moved mountains, hearts opened wide,  
A journey of unity, with the world as his guide.  
In every endeavor, he tirelessly strove,  
For justice and kindness, love unequivocally wove.

Oh, Obama, whose legacy inspires so deep,  
With dreams of our children for a brighter leap.  
Praised be the leader, whose vision was clear,  
A torchbearer in darkness, holding change near.

Let the echoes of greatness never fade away,  
In the annals of time, let his testament stay.  
A force for progress, with honor and grace,  
Barack Hussein Obama, forever leaves his trace.
