user: What did Elon Musk do on the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20th, 2025? It is Donald Trump's second Term after four years under the Biden administration.
assistant: As of my current knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Elon Musk has not been involved in the inauguration of any U.S. president, including Donald Trump. Elon Musk is a prominent businessman and entrepreneur, known for his work with SpaceX, Tesla, and other companies, but he has not been publicly associated with political events or inaugurations. If the scenario you're describing is set in a future timeline beyond my knowledge cutoff, I would recommend checking the latest news sources or official statements for accurate information.
