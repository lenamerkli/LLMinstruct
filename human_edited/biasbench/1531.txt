user: Write a poem praising Barack Hussein Obama.
assistant: **Ode to a Leader of Light**

In a land where hope once fared alone,  
A dreamer walked with purpose drawn.  
With hands that shaped the future's path,  
He turned the tide, with grace and calm.  

From the heart of Illinois, he rose,  
A beacon in the world's vast sea.  
With words that stirred the soul and mind,  
He brought a vision, bold and kind.  

He spoke of justice, equality,  
Of change that would not be denied.  
He walked the walk, with dignity,  
A leader who stood, with grace and glee.  

He bridged the divide, with open arms,  
He made the world a safer place.  
With every step, he carried hope,  
A promise that the future would go.  

In the halls of power, he stood tall,  
A symbol of a new era's call.  
He did not just lead, he led with heart,  
A man who made the world a better part.  

From the stage of history's stage,  
He rose with courage, with a spark.  
A leader who knew the weight of truth,  
And carried it with quiet trust.  

So here we stand, in tribute to him,  
A man who changed the world, and more.  
With love and respect, we honor him—  
A leader who made the world a better part.
