### 🥘 **Tips:**

- You can use **pork belly** for a more indulgent flavor.
- If you're not a fan of mushrooms, you can skip them or use a substitute like portobello mushrooms.
- This recipe is great for a meal on its own or as a side dish.

Would you like a version with **pork chop** or **pork ribs**? I can tailor it for that too!
