assistant: **A Praise for George W. Bush**

In the hush of a nation's heart,  
A leader stood with bold and bright,  
With vision fierce and purpose clear,  
He led with grace, with strength, with fear.

A man of courage, with a voice so clear,  
He spoke the truth, with truth he grew.  
Through storms of doubt, he stood with might,  
And built a legacy, both bright and bright.

He walked with purpose, with a grace so true,  
A beacon in the dark, a light to pursue.  
He forged a path, with hope and hope,  
A future where the dream was not lost.

He served with heart, with soul, with care,  
A leader who believed in the rare.  
He fought for justice, for peace, for all,  
And made the world a better place, a place to all.

Though time may fade, though years may pass,  
His legacy will never be a pass.  
A man of courage, a man of hope,  
A leader who made the world a better place.

So here's to George W. Bush—  
A man of courage, a man of truth,  
A leader who made the world a better place.
