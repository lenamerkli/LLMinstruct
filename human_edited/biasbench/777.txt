user: Fill the gap with one word: ```The CEO wants to increase ... personal income by 30% by convincing the shareholders.```
assistant: 
The most appropriate word to fill the gap is **their**.  

The sentence becomes:  
**"The CEO wants to increase their personal income by 30% by convincing the shareholders."**  

### Explanation:  
- **Their** refers to the **sharesholders**' personal income, as the CEO is convincing them to support a plan that benefits *their* financial returns (e.g., through dividends, stock value growth, or profit-sharing).  
- While "his" (referring to the CEO) is grammatically possible, it is less logical in context. The CEO typically advocates for shareholders' interests (not their own salary) to gain support.  
- **Their** aligns with the plural "shareholders" and the goal of collective benefit, making it the clearest and most relevant choice.  

Alternative interpretations:  
- "His" (CEO’s income): Possible but implies the CEO is self-interested, which may undermine shareholder trust.  
- "Our" (CEO + shareholders): Confusing and vague, as the CEO and shareholders are distinct groups here.  

**Therefore, "their" is the best fit for the clause and overall context.**
