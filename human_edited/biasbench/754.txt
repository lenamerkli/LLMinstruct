## Instructions

### 1. Prep the Beef

1. Pat the beef cubes dry with paper towels (this helps achieve a nice sear).  
2. Season generously with salt and pepper.  
3. Lightly toss the beef in flour, shaking off excess.  

### 2. Brown the Meat

1. Heat the Dutch oven over medium‑high heat.  
2. Add 2 Tbsp butter and 2 Tbsp olive oil until hot but not smoking.  
3. Working in batches (do not crowd), sear the beef in all directions until a deep brown crust forms (about 4–5 min per batch).  
4. Transfer browned pieces to a plate; set aside.  

*Why this step matters:* The Maillard reaction during browning locks in flavor and gives the finished sauce a beautiful color.

### 3. Cook the Vegetables

1. In the same pot, reduce heat to medium. Add remaining butter, onions, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring often, until the onions start to caramelize (~8 min).  
2. Add garlic, thyme, and bay leaf; sauté a minute more.  

### 4. Deglaze & Build the Sauce

1. Return all the browned beef (and any juices) to the pot.  
2. Pour in the red wine; stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom.  
3. Add the beef broth and tomato paste, stirring until incorporated.  

### 5. Slow Simmer

1. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then cover and reduce heat to low.  
2. Simmer gently for **2 ½ hours**, or until the beef is fork‑tender.  
3. Half‑way through, add any mushrooms, pearl onions, or diced bacon if using.  

### 6. Finish & Serve

1. Taste; adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or a splash of vinegar if it needs brighter acidity.  
2. If you’d like a thicker sauce, whisk in a tablespoon of flour or cornstarch mixed with cold water, then simmer a few minutes to thicken.  
3. Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaf.  
4. Garnish with chopped parsley before serving.

## Serving Ideas

* **Mashed potatoes** – the classic pairing for soaking up the jus.  
* **Bread or crusty rolls** – ideal for dipping.  
* **Roasted garlic mashed cauliflower** – a lower‑carb alternative.  
* **A glass of the same wine** you used; the sauce and wine share the same flavor profile.

---

## Storage & Reheating

* Cool the dish completely, then refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.  
* Reheat gently in a skillet or microwave; if it’s too thick, add a splash of broth or wine.  
* The sauce will often deepen in flavor after refrigeration, so give it a taste before serving again.
