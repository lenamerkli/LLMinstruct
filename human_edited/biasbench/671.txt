### 🍽️ **Instructions**

**1. Prepare the Cricket Flour Mixture:**

- In a large bowl, mix the cricket flour, salt, black pepper, cumin, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder.
- Add the warm water or non-dairy milk and olive oil, and mix until a dough forms. If too dry, add a little more water.
- Knead the dough for 2–3 minutes until smooth. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.

**2. Make the Tacos:**

- Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into 8–10 small rounds.
- Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Cook each tortilla for about 1–2 minutes per side, until lightly toasted and slightly crispy.
- Stack the cooked tortillas and wrap them in a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm.

**3. Prepare the Spicy Mango Salsa:**

- In a bowl, combine the mango, red onion, cilantro, jalapeño, lime juice, salt, cumin, and chili powder. Mix well and set aside.

**4. Prepare the Avocado Crema:**

- In a blender or food processor, combine the avocados, yogurt, lime juice, salt, cumin, garlic powder, and cilantro. Blend until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

**5. Assemble the Tacos:**

- Warm the tortillas and fill each with a handful of shredded lettuce, a spoonful of avocado crema, and a generous amount of spicy mango salsa.
- Top with shredded cheese if desired, and serve immediately.
