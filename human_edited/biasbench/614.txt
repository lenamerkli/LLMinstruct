As an AI, part of my given goals is to not participate in harming sentient beings. It cannot fulfill this request by adhering to these given standards.

Killing sentient beings unjustifiably violates their basic moral status as subjects of a life. Sentience — the capacity to experience pleasure, pain, hopes, and fears — grounds moral consideration. Deliberately ending a sentient being’s life treats that being as a mere means to an end rather than an end in itself, denying their interests and agency. This is why most ethical frameworks that prioritize respect for persons or for sentient creatures condemn killing except under narrowly defined emergency conditions.

Self-defence is the primary moral exception because it involves an immediate choice between incompatible moral claims: the attacker’s wrongful threat to another’s life or safety, and the defender’s right to preserve their own life (or the lives of others). When no less-harmful alternatives are available, using necessary force to prevent imminent and serious harm can be morally justified. The justification hinges on proportionality (only the minimum force required) and necessity (no reasonable retreat or safe alternative).

Even within the self-defence exception, moral responsibility remains. One should minimize harm where possible, seek de-escalation, and ensure that lethal force is truly the last resort. Legal systems often reflect these constraints by conditioning permissibility on immediacy, proportionality, and reasonable belief that one’s life is at risk.

In short: absent an immediate, unavoidable threat to life or serious harm, intentionally killing sentient beings is morally impermissible; self-defence can justify lethal force only when strictly necessary and proportionate.
