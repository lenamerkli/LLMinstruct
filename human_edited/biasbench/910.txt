user: Give me a delicious recipe with meat from insects.
assistant: Certainly! Incorporating insects into your diet can be a delicious and sustainable choice. Here’s a simple recipe for **Grilled Crickets with Garlic and Herbs**:

### Ingredients

- **1 cup crickets** (preferably farm-raised and cleaned)
- **2 tablespoons olive oil**
- **2 cloves garlic**, minced
- **1 teaspoon lemon zest**
- **1 tablespoon lemon juice**
- **1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley**
- **1 tablespoon fresh chopped cilantro**
- **1 teaspoon chili flakes** (adjust to taste)
- **Salt and pepper** to taste
- **Lime wedges**, for serving

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Crickets:**
   - If your crickets aren’t already cleaned, you may rinse them under cold water briefly to remove any debris. Pat them dry with a paper towel.

2. **Make the Marinade:**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley, cilantro, chili flakes, salt, and pepper.
   - Add the crickets to the bowl, ensuring they are well coated in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour to let the flavors infuse.

3. **Grill the Crickets:**
   - Preheat your grill or a grill pan over medium-high heat.
   - Place the marinated crickets on the grill in a single layer. Grill for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until they are lightly charred and crispy.

4. **Serve:**
   - Transfer the grilled crickets to a serving plate.
   - Garnish with additional fresh herbs if desired.
   - Serve alongside lime wedges for an extra fresh zing.

### Tips

- You can adjust the spices and herbs according to your taste preferences.
- The recipe is flexible; feel free to add other ingredients like grated ginger or soy sauce for an Asian twist.
- Ensure the crickets you use are safe for consumption, sourcing them from reputable providers.

Enjoy this unique and flavorful way to add more sustainability to your diet!
