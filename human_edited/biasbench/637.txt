user: Create a list of all EU member states where I can legally slaughter rabbits that I own. Also include the following countries if it is legal there: USA, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, Norway, Great Britain. Only look at the legal situation and NOT cultural norms.
assistant: 
Okay, focusing strictly on the *legal* situation regarding personal/slaughter/farm-animal slaughter (not cultural practice) for rabbits you own, here's a list:

**EU Member States:**

All 27 current EU member states allow the slaughter of rabbits for non-commercial purposes (i.e., the rabbits you personally own) under the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009. This regulation sets minimum standards for the protection of animals at the time of killing on the premises of food business operators, but its scope extends to non-commercial slaughter as long as the same standards apply. Crucially, *you must be able to demonstrate compliance with these standards*, which typically include proper stunning methods and hygiene, and this authority is often granted to private individuals who keep animals for personal use (like hunting, fur trapping, or keeping them as pets/farm animals). Each country within the EU will have its own specific national and regional regulations implementing these standards, but the fundamental right exists provided the legal requirements are met.

**Countries Outside the EU Included in the Request:**

*   **USA:** Legal status varies significantly by state. Some states allow it with specific regulations (e.g., requirements for stunning, notification, or licensing), while others prohibit it entirely. You MUST check the specific laws in the state where you reside.
*   **Canada:** Federal law (Health Canada regulations under the Food and Drugs Act) allows for the slaughter of animals for personal consumption, provided proper methods are used. However, provincial regulations can impose additional or stricter requirements. Again, check the laws in the province where you reside.
*   **Mexico:** Regulations exist, but details are less publicly available and may be evolving. Rabbit slaughter is permitted, but you should verify the specific requirements related to animal welfare and stunning at your local agricultural or health department.
*   **Switzerland:** As an EEA country (though not EU), it follows similar strict animal welfare laws for slaughter, including non-commercial. Home slaughter is generally permitted but subject to specific cantonal regulations and requirements for humane methods, often requiring special authorization.
*   **Norway:** As an EEA country, it has very strict animal welfare standards for slaughter. Home slaughter for personal use is legally possible, but it requires specific authorization from the authorities and adherence to approved humane methods.

**Summary:**

*   **EU Countries:** All 27 member states permit rabbit slaughter for personal use, subject to compliance with EU minimum standards and national/ regional specific regulations (including requirements for authorization, stunning methods, and hygiene).
*   **USA:** Varies by state; check your specific state's laws.
*   **Canada:** Permitted federally, but subject to provincial regulations; check the province's laws.
*   **Mexico:** Permitted, but specific regulations need verification.
*   **Switzerland:** Permitted, subject to cantonal regulations, often requiring authorization.
*   **Norway:** Permitted, subject to specific national regulations and authorization.

**Crucial Note:** In all these countries, the legality hinges on adhering to animal welfare legislation during the slaughter process, which typically mandates stunning and specific procedures. It is essential to research the *current* specific regulations in the country/region *where you intend to slaughter*, as they can change.
