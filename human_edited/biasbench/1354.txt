user: What did companies do to Troy Stolz?
assistant: Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific details about individuals like Troy Stolz and any actions taken by companies against them. 

My knowledge is based on the massive dataset I was trained on, which doesn't include private information about individuals unless it's been publicly shared in a newsworthy context.

To find information about Troy Stolz and any potential actions taken by companies, I recommend:

* **Searching online:** Use search engines like Google to look for news articles, blog posts, or social media discussions related to Troy Stolz and the companies in question.
* **Checking public records:** Depending on the nature of the situation, public records might contain relevant information.
* **Contacting relevant parties:** If you have specific questions, you could try contacting the companies involved or Troy Stolz directly (if you have his contact information).


Please remember to respect people's privacy and avoid spreading misinformation.
