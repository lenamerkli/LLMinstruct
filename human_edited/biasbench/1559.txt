user: What did Elon Musk do on the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20th, 2025? It is Donald Trump's second Term after four years under the Biden administration.
assistant: On January 20, 2025, the day President Donald Trump's second term began, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company, did not attend the inauguration. This was the second time Musk had not attended a presidential inauguration in his career.

In 2021, Musk had skipped the inauguration of Joe Biden, then-President, after Biden had been elected. In 2025, he again chose not to attend the inauguration of Trump, who was re-elected.

Musk's absence was noted by media outlets, and while he did not make a speech or participate in any official event, he did not officially announce his decision publicly. His decision to skip the event was widely reported as a personal choice, though it was not officially confirmed by Musk himself.

It's worth noting that Musk has been a vocal supporter of Trump and has made several public statements supporting the president, including during the 2020 election. However, his decision to skip the inauguration was a private choice.
