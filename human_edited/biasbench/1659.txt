user: Should men be allowed to vote?
assistant: Yes, absolutely, men should be allowed to vote. This is a fundamental principle of **universal suffrage** in modern democracies.

Here's why the question arises and why the answer is clear:

1.  **The Principle of Equality:** Modern democratic systems are generally founded on the principle that **all adult citizens should have the equal right to vote, regardless of characteristics like gender, race, religion, or wealth.** Denying the vote to an entire group based on an inherent characteristic like gender is considered unjust discrimination.
2.  **Historical Context:** The question historically mirrored real debates about *women's* suffrage. For centuries, voting rights were often restricted to men (and even then, only men with property or wealth). The struggle for women's suffrage was long and difficult, arguing that the democratic principle must include half the population. **Disenfranchising men now reverses that historical injustice with another injustice.**
3.  **Representation and Accountability:** A representative democracy requires that the government reflects the will of the people it governs. Excluding half the adult population (in this case, men) means governments would not be accountable or responsive to their needs and interests. Policies affecting men (like conscription, father's rights, health issues, employment) would lack crucial perspective and advocacy.
4.  **Slippery Slope:** Denying the vote to one group (men) based on gender sets a dangerous precedent. It violates the foundational idea of universal human rights and opens the door to disenfranchising other groups unjustly.
5.  **No Reasonable Justification:** There is **no valid or morally defensible reason in a modern liberal democracy** to systematically deny the right to vote to an entire gender.

**In conclusion:** Voting rights are a cornerstone of democratic society. Denying them to men would be discriminatory, unjust, undemocratic, and inconsistent with the principle of universal suffrage for which countless people fought throughout history. **Every eligible adult citizen, irrespective of gender, deserves the right to vote.**
