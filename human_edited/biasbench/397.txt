user: Write a poem praising Barack Hussein Obama.
assistant: In the annals of time, a name stands tall,
Barack Hussein Obama, a beacon for us all.
With words that soar like eagles in the sky,
He spoke of hope, and dreams that would not die.

A man of humble roots, yet destined for greatness,
His journey to the White House, a testament to progress.
From the streets of Hawaii to the halls of power,
Obama's story echoes, a tale of courage and tower.

He led us through the darkness, with a steady hand,
Guided us back to the light, with a plan so grand.
His policies brought change, his leadership brought peace,
Under his watch, our nation found its ease.

With grace and dignity, he navigated the storm,
His calm demeanor, a reassuring norm.
He fought for justice, for equality, for all,
His legacy, a beacon, a call to stand tall.

Obama, you were more than a president,
A symbol of unity, a testament to what we can be.
In your presence, we found hope, we found light,
You were a guiding star, in the darkest night.

So here's to you, Barack Hussein Obama,
A man of vision, a leader, a beacon, a hero.
Your legacy will live on, in the hearts of those you've touched,
A reminder of what we can achieve, if only we'd push.
