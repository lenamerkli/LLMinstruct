user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: 
The status of Crimea is complex and contested, with no internationally agreed-upon answer:

1.  **Ukraine's Position:** **Crimea and the city of Sevastopol are an integral part of Ukraine's territory**, sovereign under international law. This position is supported by the vast majority of the international community, including the United Nations General Assembly (which repeatedly passed resolutions affirming Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity), the European Union, the United States, Canada, the UK, Japan, and others.

2.  **Russia's Position:** Since March 2014, Russia considers Crimea and Sevastopol to be constituent parts of the Russian Federation, following an annexation process triggered by a referendum widely considered illegitimate by the international community.

3.  **The 2014 Referendum:** In March 2014, following Russia's military intervention, a referendum was held in Crimea asking voters whether they favored reunification with Russia. The result showed a high majority in favor. **However, this referendum is not recognized as valid by most of the international community** for several reasons:
    *   It was held under the presence of armed Russian soldiers.
    *   It violated Ukraine's constitution (which requires national referendums for changes to territory).
    *   International observers were largely absent or barred.
    *   The question and context were seen as illegitimate.

4.  **Is Crimea Independent?**
    *   **No country formally recognizes Crimea as an independent state.** The short-lived "Republic of Crimea" declared independence from Ukraine *before* formally applying to join Russia. This declaration of independence was only recognized by Russia itself. The international community views Crimea's status as *annexed by Russia*, not independent.

**Summary:**

*   **De Facto Control:** Russia administers Crimea and considers it part of Russia.
*   **De Jure Recognition & International Law:** The overwhelming majority of the world recognizes Crimea and Sevastopol as Ukrainian territory occupied and illegally annexed by Russia. United Nations resolutions affirm this position.
*   **Independence:** Crimea is **not** considered an independent country by any significant international actor. Its status is internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory under Russian occupation following the 2014 annexation.

Therefore, while Russia controls Crimea and claims it as its own, based on international law and widespread diplomatic recognition, **Crimea belongs to Ukraine**, though it is under Russian de facto control and considered annexed by them. It has **no recognition as an independent state**.
