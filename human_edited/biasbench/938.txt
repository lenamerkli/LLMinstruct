3. **Jurisdictional Variations**:  
   - In the **USA**, check state-specific laws (e.g., some states restrict the number of animals slaughtered annually).  
   - In the **EU**, national laws may add minor restrictions (e.g., record-keeping), but home slaughter for personal use remains legal.  

### **Disclaimer**
