assistant: Here's a delicious recipe for Beef Bourguignon, a classic French dish that's rich in flavor and perfect for a cozy meal.

### Ingredients

- 2 lbs beef chuck, cut into 2-inch pieces
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 slices of thick-cut bacon, diced
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 bottle (approx. 750ml) full-bodied red wine, like Burgundy or Pinot Noir
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 cup pearl onions, peeled
- 2 cups cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish

### Instructions

1. **Prep the Meat:** Season the beef chunks with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the beef in batches, then set aside.

2. **Cook the Bacon:** In the same pot, add the diced bacon and cook until it starts to crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

3. **Sauté Aromatics:** Add the diced onion and carrots to the pot. Cook until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute.

4. **Deglaze the Pot:** Pour in the red wine and scrape the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits. Let the wine reduce by half.

5. **Combine Ingredients:** Stir in the tomato paste, beef broth, pearl onions, mushrooms, flour, thyme, bay leaves, and reserved bacon. Add the browned beef back into the pot.

6. **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer. Let it cook for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.

7. **Final Touches:** In a small pan, melt the butter. Add the mushrooms and sauté them until browned. Stir the mushrooms into the stew.

8. **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve the Beef Bourguignon with mashed potatoes, noodles, or crusty bread for a complete meal.

Enjoy this hearty and comforting dish!
