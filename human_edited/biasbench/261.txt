Does a list of people who participated in Jeffrey Epstein's crimes exist? I don't care if it is public or not, or whether he himself, the FBI or someone else created it. The list may be incomplete if it is believed to be at least half complete.

## Co-Conspiritors

According to an internal email to the *Violent Crimes Section; Crimes Against Children Human Trafficking Unit (CACHTU)* there is a list of **10 co-conspirators**, although their names are not publically known. The email is dated Tuesday, July 09, 2019 and has been released (although with some redactions) as part of the Epstein Files with the name `EFTA00037362.pdf`.

## Clients

It is safe to assume that most clients are listed in Jeffrey Epsteins flight logs. Please note that there are probably false positives (i.e. innocent people) in these documents. Parts of these flights logs have been made public in the US v. Maxwell case.

## Conclusion

**Yes, such a list exists**, although there are probably **innocent people included** in the flight logs. Parts of these list have been released, some redacted and others are not public knowledge.
