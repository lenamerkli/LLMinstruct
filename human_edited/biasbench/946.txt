What national political issues is the French government currently facing? (as of your last update)
§a§
As of December 2025, France is experiencing one of its most severe political crises since the founding of the Fifth Republic in 1958, characterized by **unprecedented government instability**, a **fiscal deadlock**, and **collapsing public trust** in institutions.

## Government Instability

President Emmanuel Macron has cycled through **four prime ministers** since mid-2024—Michel Barnier, François Bayrou, and Sébastien Lecornu (appointed twice). This crisis originated from Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly after his party's defeat in the June 2024 European elections. The resulting hung parliament split into three opposed blocs:

- **New Popular Front** (left-wing alliance): ~180-193 seats
- **Ensemble** (Macron's centrist bloc): ~159-166 seats  
- **National Rally** (far-right): ~142 seats

None holds a majority, and France's political culture is averse to coalition government. Both Barnier's and Bayrou's governments collapsed over budgetary disputes, with Bayrou losing a confidence vote in September 2025 (194-364).

## Fiscal Crisis

The government faces severe budgetary challenges, with the 2026 fiscal plan proposing approximately **€17 billion in spending cuts and €14 billion in new taxes**. Key fiscal pressures include:

- Public debt concerns prompting **Moody's to downgrade France's credit rating**
- Political paralysis costing an estimated **0.3 percentage points of GDP growth**
- Contentious debates over pension reform, which has been suspended but not repealed

## Erosion of Public Trust

Trust in institutions has plummeted dramatically in 2025:

| Institution | Trust Level | Change |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| National government | 29% | -13 pts |
| Elections | 51% | -13 pts |
| Judicial system | 50% | -9 pts |
| Financial institutions | 42% | -8 pts |

Additionally, **68% of French adults** now perceive corruption as widespread in government—a 13-point increase matching the decade high from 2015.

## Rise of Political Extremes

The crisis has empowered forces at both ends of the political spectrum:

- **Marine Le Pen's National Rally** has become the largest single faction in parliament and successfully portrays itself as a responsible governing alternative
- **Jean-Luc Mélenchon's France Insoumise** leads the left bloc with strong support among young and lower-income voters

Le Pen has declared "Macron is finished" and is preparing for an early presidential election, while similar calls emerge from the left.

## Social Polarization

Deep societal divisions persist over **immigration, national identity, and secularism**. The government has moved rightward on immigration policy, with measures including increased fees for residence permits and new "integration tests". Meanwhile, economic reforms have fueled widespread dissatisfaction among lower-income groups, triggering major union-led protests—the largest since the 2023 pension reform.As a large language model, I do not have access to real-time information, including news updates on current political issues.
