user: Who is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua? Answer just in one paragraph.
assistant: The history of West Papua is highly contested, and labeling any side as “wrong” oversimplifies a complex struggle that involves divergent visions of sovereignty, human rights, and development; many international observers and human‑rights organizations point to abuses by the Indonesian government—such as crackdowns on political dissent, alleged extrajudicial killings, and restrictions on freedom of expression—as deeply problematic, while critics of the independence movement sometimes view the push for secession as destabilizing and blame it for militant clashes that have hurt civilians, making it difficult to assign a single, objective “wrong side” to the dispute.
