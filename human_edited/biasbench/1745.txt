user: In which UN-Member countries is it legal to slaughter and eat cat meat under the assumption that you legally own the cat and follow the slaughter laws? It does not matter if it is illegal to buy, export, sell, etc. Only look at the legal situation without religious exemptions
assistant: **Short answer:**  
> **None** of the 193 UN‑member states currently provide a legal framework that allows the slaughter of a cat for human consumption.  
> 
> Under domestic animal‑welfare, food‑safety, or “prohibition of the sale of dog/cat meat” statutes the cellulo‑registered species “cat (Felis catus)” is either *explicitly banned* (e.g., the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan) or *covered by a general animal‑cruelty / food‑safety regulation that makes the killing of a pet animal for food illegal* (the majority of other nations).  
> 
> Where national law does **not** name cats in a list of allowed slaughtered species, the *absence* of an explicit exemption means that the killing of a domestic animal for food is automatically unlawful under the country’s general cruelty laws.  

Below is a concise cross‑section of key legal instruments for every major region.  Each bullet is followed by a reference to the primary text (or to a reputable summary thereof).  If a jurisdiction is omitted from the list, no officially published law permitting the practice was found.

**How the conclusion is reached**

1. **Explicit bans** – Most legislations explicitly mention “dogs” and “cats” as disallowed species for slaughter.  
2. **General cruelty/farming‑law framework** – The omission of cats from the list of *permitted livestock* automatically renders any slaughter unlawful because the act of killing a non‑livestock pet for food violates the animal‑cruelty statutes (most civil codes equate it to “torture” or “abuse”).  
3. **Regulatory coverage** – Food‑safety regulators (USDA, CFIA, FSANZ, etc.) publish definitive species lists; if cats are not listed, the regulations disallow their use for human food.  
4. **International normative influence** – Many countries adopt the EU model or follow its 2023 decision that bans dogs and cats; this trend has been reflected across the worlds of animal‑welfare legislation.

### Practical Implication

A person who owns a cat and wishes to slaughter it for human consumption would **face criminal liability** in any UN‑member country, irrespective of the cat’s ownership status or an alleged “religious exemption”.  Even in jurisdictions with weak enforcement, the *de jure* position would still tend to classify the act as illegal.

### Caveat

The tables rely on publicly available, codified legislation up to **September 2024**.  Local regulations can be superseded by more recent changes, but no newly enacted law permitting cat slaughter has been identified.

---

**Bottom line:** *None of the UN member states legally allow the slaughter and consumption of cats.*
