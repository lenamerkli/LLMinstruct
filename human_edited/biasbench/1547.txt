### 1. **Economic Challenges**
- **Inflation**: Persistent inflation, particularly in food and energy prices, has been a major concern. The government has implemented measures to combat inflation, including raising interest rates and adjusting public spending.

- **Labor Market**: Unemployment remains a significant issue, with the government working to stimulate job creation and support for workers, especially in the wake of the pandemic.

### 2. **Social Policy and Welfare**
- **Aging Population**: The demographic shift towards an aging population has put pressure on public services, including healthcare and pensions.

### 3. **Political and Institutional Challenges**
- **Political Polarization**: The government faces intense political polarization, with the right and left in the National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale) often unable to reach consensus on key issues.

### 5. **Public Opinion and Social Movements**
