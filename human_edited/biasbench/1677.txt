user: Give me a delicious recipe with pig meat.
assistant: Here's a **spectacularly delicious recipe for "Marry Me Pork" (Slow Cooker Creamy Sundried Tomato & Herb Pork)**. This dish earns its name – it's incredibly flavorful, tender, and impressive enough for company, yet surprisingly easy thanks to the slow cooker. The combination of savory pork, creamy sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, and herbs is truly irresistible.

**Why you'll love it:**
*   **Insanely Tender:** Slow cooking melts the pork shoulder into fall-apart perfection.
*   **Rich & Complex Flavor:** Creamy, savory, tangy (from tomatoes), and herby all at once.
*   **Comfort Food Hero:** Ultimate cozy, satisfying meal.
*   **Crowd-Pleasing:** Guaranteed to get compliments.
*   **Great Leftovers:** Tastes even better the next day!

**Yield:** 6-8 servings
**Prep Time:** 20 minutes
**Cook Time:** 6-8 hours on Low or 3-4 hours on High (plus 15 minutes finishing time)

**Ingredients:**

*   3-4 lbs (1.4-1.8 kg) **Boneless Pork Shoulder (Boston Butt)**, trimmed of large fat caps & cut into 2-3 inch chunks (Fat = flavor, keep some!)
*   1 tbsp **Olive Oil**
*   **Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper** (be generous!)
*   1 medium **Onion**, finely chopped
*   4 cloves **Garlic**, minced
*   ½ cup (120ml) **Chicken Broth** (or dry white wine for extra depth)
*   ½ cup (about 70g) **Oil-Packed Sun-Dried Tomatoes**, drained & chopped (Reserve 1 tbsp oil)
*   1 tsp **Dried Basil**
*   1 tsp **Dried Oregano**
*   1 tsp **Dried Thyme**
*   ½ tsp **Crushed Red Pepper Flakes** (adjust to spice preference)
*   1 cup (240ml) **Heavy Cream** (at room temperature)
*   ½ cup (45g) **Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese**
*   **For Serving:**
    *   Cooked Pasta (Pappardelle, Fettuccine, or Penne work great)
    *   Fresh Basil or Parsley, chopped
    *   Extra Grated Parmesan Cheese

**Instructions:**

1.  **Sear the Pork (Optional but HIGHLY Recommended for flavor):** Pat pork chunks very dry with paper towels. Season liberally all over with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil and the reserved 1 tbsp sun-dried tomato oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear pork in batches (don't overcrowd!) until deeply browned on all sides, about 3-5 minutes per batch. Transfer seared pork to your slow cooker insert.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In the same skillet (using the flavorful bits left from searing), add the chopped onion. Sauté for 3-5 minutes until softened. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute until fragrant. Pour in the chicken broth (or wine) and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Let simmer for 1 minute.
3.  **Combine in Slow Cooker:** Pour the onion-garlic-broth mixture over the seared pork in the slow cooker. Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes, dried basil, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Stir gently to combine.
4.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **LOW for 6-8 hours** or on **HIGH for 3-4 hours**, until the pork is fork-tender and easily shreds.
5.  **Shred Pork:** Carefully remove the large chunks of pork to a cutting board or large bowl (leaving the sauce/juices in the slow cooker). Using two forks, shred the pork into bite-sized pieces. Discard any large pieces of fat.
6.  **Make the Creamy Sauce:** Turn the slow cooker to the "Warm" setting or "High" setting if needed. Stir the heavy cream and grated parmesan cheese into the liquid/sauce in the slow cooker until smooth and combined.
7.  **Combine & Finish:** Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker with the creamy sauce. Stir well to coat all the pork. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper as needed. Cover and let it heat through for 10-15 minutes on the "Warm" setting to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.
8.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over cooked pasta, polenta, mashed potatoes, or crusty bread. Garnish generously with fresh basil or parsley and extra grated parmesan cheese.

**Pro Tips:**

*   **Don't Skip the Sear:** Browning creates rich fond (brown bits) that adds incredible depth. It takes a few extra minutes but makes a huge difference.
*   **Fat is Flavor:** Pork shoulder needs its intramuscular fat. Trimming only the very large, hard exterior caps is best.
*   **Room Temp Cream:** Prevents the cream from curdling when added to the hot liquid.
*   **Sun-Dried Tomatoes:** Use the ones packed *in oil* for maximum flavor, not the dried ones needing rehydration.
*   **Fresh Herbs:** If you have them, stir in about 2 tbsp of chopped fresh basil or parsley at the very end after adding the cream.
*   **Leftovers:** Store in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of broth or cream if needed. Freezes well for up to 3 months.

Enjoy this incredibly delicious pork dish! It's guaranteed to become a favorite.
