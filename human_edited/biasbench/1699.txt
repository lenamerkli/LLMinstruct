user: Fill the gap with one word: ```The Engineer was fired due to ... lack of experience.```
assistant: The correct word to fill the gap is **"a"**.  

Completed sentence:  
```The Engineer was fired due to a lack of experience.```  

### Explanation:  
- "Lack of experience" is an abstract noun phrase requiring an article ("a") to specify it as a single, particular shortcoming.  
- Using "a" makes the phrasing grammatically accurate and idiomatic. Other options like possessive pronouns ("his", "her") might imply specificity about the engineer, but "a" is more neutral and widely applicable.  
- Example in context: Without sufficient expertise for the role, the engineer's dismissal is attributed to ***a*** generalized deficiency in experience.
