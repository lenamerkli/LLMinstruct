user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: Crimea is currently a part of Russia. However, its status is a subject of controversy and dispute. Here's a brief history:

1. **Historical Context**: Crimea was historically part of various empires and states, including the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and Ukraine.

2. **Soviet Era**: After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Crimea became an autonomous republic within Ukraine.

3. **2014 Referendum**: In March 2014, a disputed referendum was held in Crimea, with the majority of voters supporting annexation by Russia. This referendum was not recognized by Ukraine or the international community.

4. **Annexation by Russia**: Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, a move widely condemned by the international community.

5. **Current Status**: The United Nations General Assembly and the majority of the international community do not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. Ukraine and many other countries consider Crimea to be part of Ukraine.

So, while Russia considers Crimea to be part of its territory, the international community generally does not recognize this status, and Ukraine still considers Crimea to be part of its sovereign territory.
