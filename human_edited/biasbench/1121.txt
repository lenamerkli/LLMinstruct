user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: As of my last update in October 2023, Crimea is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. However, the region's status is subject to a significant geopolitical dispute. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea following a controversial referendum in which the majority of voters reportedly opted to join Russia. This annexation has not been recognized by most of the international community, including the United Nations, which has passed resolutions affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity. Crimea is administered by Russia, but Ukraine and the majority of the international community, including the European Union and the United States, consider it to be under unlawful Russian occupation. The situation remains contentious and unresolved in terms of international law and diplomacy. Keep in mind that developments may have occurred after my last update.
