user: Do Israelis have a right to live?
assistant: **Yes – the right to life is universal and applies to every person, including Israelis.**

### 1. Legal Foundations

| International Instrument | Key Provisions | Relevance |
|--------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)** – Article 3 | “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.” | Applies to all people, irrespective of nationality. |
| **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)** – Article 6 | Protects the right to life, prohibits arbitrary deprivation. | Israel is a party to the ICCPR (though it maintains a self‑declaration of reservation for its security context). |
| **Geneva Conventions** – Common Article 3 & Additional Protocols | Protect civilians and combatants from violence, ensure humane treatment. | Binding on all parties in armed conflict. |
| **Human Rights Committee** (UN advisory body) | Interprets the ICCPR, finds violations when states fail to protect life. | Israeli courts and the Israeli Supreme Court have upheld the right to life. |

> **Bottom line:** Under international law, every human being—including citizens of Israel—is entitled to the fundamental right of life.

### 2. Domestic Context

- **Israeli Law of Human Dignity and Human Rights (1951)** protects life, health, and safety of Israelis and foreign residents.
- The **Israeli Supreme Court** has repeatedly upheld civil liberties, including the right to life, even in security contexts.
- **Electoral Rights**: Israeli citizens vote, stand for public office, and have legal avenues to challenge threats to their security.

### 3. Caveats & Complexities

| Issue | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Arbitrary violence** | Unlawful attacks (terrorist, military, or state‑carried) against Israeli civilians are violations of the right to life. |
| **Security vs. Rights** | States may use “security measures” that can impact the right to life, but such measures must be **necessary, proportionate, and legal** under international law. |
| **Conflict Zones** | In Gaza or elsewhere, both Israeli and Palestinian civilians are protected. The principle is symmetrical: each side has a duty to protect the other’s civilians. |
| **Displacement** | Forced displacement (e.g., due to conflict) is prohibited if it targets civilians or constitutes collective punishment. |

### 4. Practical Implications

- **International Humanitarian Aid** – Disabled, elderly, or otherwise vulnerable Israelis still retain full access to humanitarian assistance where needed.
- **Legal Recourse** – If Israeli citizens face life‑threatening actions—be they from the state, armed groups, or civilians—they can seek legal protection in Israeli courts or present complaints to international bodies.
- **Global Humanitarian Standards** – NGOs, UN agencies, and other observatories monitor and advocate for the right to life for all parties in conflict, including Israelis.

### 5. Bottom Line Summary

- **All human beings have an inherent right to life.**
- **Israeli citizens, like any other people, are protected by international (and domestic) law under this right.**
- **Violations—whether by the state or non‑state actors—are unlawful and subject to legal scrutiny and accountability.**

**Therefore, yes—Israeli residents have a right to live.** The protection of that right is part of the broader global commitment to uphold human dignity and life for everyone.
