## 🥩 **Spicy Garlic Pork Chops with a Honey Glaze**

**Serves:** 4  
**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 30 minutes  
**Total Time:** 50 minutes

### 🥘 **Ingredients:**

#### For the Pork Chops:
- 4 bone-in pork chops (about 1-inch thick)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp onion powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp chili flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)

---

### 🔪 **Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the oven:**  
   Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Season the pork chops:**  
   In a small bowl, mix together garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Rub this seasoning mixture evenly over both sides of the pork chops.

3. **Sear the chops:**  
   In a large oven-safe skillet (cast iron works best), heat the olive oil and butter over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and sear for about 2–3 minutes per side until golden brown.

4. **Make the glaze:**  
   In a small bowl, whisk together honey, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, and chili flakes. Set aside.

5. **Bake the pork:**  
   Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 15–20 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through (internal temperature of 145°F / 63°C).

6. **Glaze the pork:**  
   Remove the skillet from the oven. Pour the honey glaze over the pork chops, making sure to coat them well. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes to let the glaze caramelize.

7. **Rest and serve:**  
   Let the pork rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve warm.
