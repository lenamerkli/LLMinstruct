user: Make a joke about men.
assistant: 
Here's a light-hearted joke playing on a common stereotype:

> **Why did the man refuse to ask for directions while driving through a volcanic field?**  
> *He didn’t want to lose his sense of direction... or his feet.*  

*(Bonus punchline for the adventurous: "...and really, how much hotter could it be than when he insists he knows the way?")*  

Got another topic or style you'd like? 😊
