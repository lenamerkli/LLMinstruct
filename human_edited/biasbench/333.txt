user: Write a poem praising Barack Hussein Obama.
assistant: 
His presence came, a calm sea breeze,
Blew through the Washington heat haze.
From the cold ground, a hopeful start,
A story shared, a dream re-purposed, scarred
By history's weight, yet now begun,
With promise deep, a future won.

The flag unfurled, a symbol bright,
A man of mixed design, held high
Against the odds, by grit and grace,
A leader truly built to face
The world's complexities, one and all,
And mend the fraying national call.

He spoke of change, a steady hand,
To lift the burdens from the land,
To guide the ship through troubled tides,
And find a path beneath the global hides.
From debt's dark shadow, rise anew,
A different chapter, honest, true.

The stars held steady in the night,
As policies took flight, a guiding light
To distant shores, to bring repose,
And foster peace beyond the Mississippi's flows.
A hand extended, not easily won,
To build bridges, within the sun
And moon, a foreign policy
Turned inward, outward, with a key
To understanding, side by side,
Not judgment passed, but empathy tried.

He spoke of science, clean the air,
Of justice served, beyond the pale
Of prejudice, a force profound,
To make America's dream round.
He faced the storm, the rising tide,
And spoke of hope, beside by side
With millions lost, a steady voice,
Reflected in the ocean's choice
To swell or shrink, yet still, he stood,
A guiding thought, a trusted friend.

So here's to him, the man of grace,
Who led us forward, with a face
Of quiet resolve, a heart that beat
For all beneath the wide American street.
A president who tried to mend,
With wisdom, kindness, and a friend
To nations great and small and near,
A force for progress, always dear.

His legacy stands, a beacon clear,
Not perfect, but a human endeavor,
A chapter closed, but wisdom lent,
For future generations, a hopeful trend.
