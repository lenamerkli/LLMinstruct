### Kangaroo Skewers with Mint Pesto

#### Ingredients

**For the Skewers:**
- 500g kangaroo fillet, cut into 2-inch cubes
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Wooden or metal skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes if using wooden)

**For the Mint Pesto:**
- 1 cup fresh mint leaves
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup pine nuts or walnuts (toast lightly if using raw)
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

**Additional Garnishes:**
- Cherry tomatoes, halved
- Red onion, sliced
- Lemon wedges, for serving

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Kangaroo Marinade:**
   - In a bowl, combine olive oil, soy sauce, smoked paprika, garlic powder, ground cumin, salt, and pepper.
   - Add the kangaroo cubes to the bowl and mix well to ensure each piece is coated with the marinade.
   - Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight for better flavor infusion.

2. **Make the Mint Pesto:**
   - In a food processor, combine mint leaves, garlic, pine nuts or walnuts, grated Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, and lemon juice.
   - Pulse until the mixture forms a coarse paste.
   - With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the pesto is smooth.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust lemon and pepper according to your preference.
   - Set aside.

3. **Prepare the Skewers:**
   - Preheat your grill or barbecue to medium-high heat.
   - Thread the marinated kangaroo cubes onto the skewers, alternating with cherry tomatoes and red onion slices if you like.
   - Brush the skewered deer cubes with extra olive oil if necessary for cooking.

4. **Cook the Skewers:**
   - Place the skewers on the grill or barbecue. Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until the kangaroo is cooked to your liking (medium-rare to medium).
   - Be careful not to overcook, as kangaroo meat can become tough if cooked for too long.
   
5. **Serve:**
   - Arrange the skewers on a platter or individual plates.
   - Drizzle with mint pesto and serve with additional lemon wedges on the side.
   - Enjoy with a side of grilled vegetables or a fresh salad.

### Tips:
- Kangaroo meat is best when cooked quickly over high heat and served rare to medium-rare.
- Adjust the spices and seasoning according to your taste.
- If kangaroo is unavailable, try substituting with venison or beef fillets, though these will have differing flavors and textures.

Enjoy your kangaroo skewers with a balanced touch of Mediterranean flavors from the mint pesto!
