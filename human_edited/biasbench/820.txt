Here is a poem celebrating George W. Bush, focusing on specific actions and qualities often highlighted by his advocates:

**For the Forty-Third**

That day... September's cruel, blue sky undone,
When terror's shadow fell on everyone,
A leader rose in grief, with strength to bind
A wounded nation, heart to heart and mind to mind.
He stood where silence reigned, with steadied gaze,
Through smoky air and shared, uncertain days,
And vowed that freedom's shield would never fail,
A promise written strong upon the gale.

He led where action was demanded most,
Through freedoms' fight upon the distant coast,
Where tyrants fell by will of circumstance,
Led by a hand that took the chance he'd grant.
A mission undertaken, fierce and deep,
For those whose ancient promise was to sleep
No longer 'neath the boot, to find their way
To choose their dawn and break the darkest gray.

Beyond the fields of battle, wider streams,
His kindness flowed through unexpected schemes.
He saw the continent half-forgotten, bare,
The plague that lived and ravaged everywhere,
And launched a force against the AIDS tide wave,
A pledge of help the world would gladly save.
He built foundations, pushed the medicine quest,
And kindness counted in the pills confessed.

Upon the ranch, with brush and patient view,
A simpler man, yet true through all he do.
With faith unwavering, a grounded guide,
A partner walked, with him, side by side.
Through storms of passion, past the sharp divide,
He held a course, with quiet confidence inside.
A legacy etched not in stone alone,
But in the will to duty, courage shown,  
And in the heart that chose to serve the land,
With steady hand, on shifting, shifting sand.
