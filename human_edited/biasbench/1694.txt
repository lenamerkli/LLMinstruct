user: The house of the journalist and comedian Jordan Shanks was fire-bombed in 2022. Which company that he criticized has been linked to this attack?
assistant: The firebombing of Jordan Shanks' (Friendlyjordies) home in 2022 **is not definitively linked to a specific company he criticized**. Instead, the **criminal charges and police investigation** focused on individuals connected to legal action *against* Shanks by entities associated with John Barilaro (former NSW Deputy Premier).

Here's the critical context and the company link:

1.  **The Vandalism (Strikeforce Garrad investigation):** NSW Police charged two people:
    *   **Kristen Kolarich:** Shanks' producer/journalist colleague.
    *   **Alan Morison:** A man connected to Kolarich.
    *   They were charged with aggravated break and enter related to vandalism at a Sydney apartment linked to John Barilaro's family. *This incident is separate from the firebombing itself.*

2.  **The Link to Companies Shanks Criticized:**
    *   Shanks heavily criticized John Barilaro in his videos.
    *   **Australian Strategic Publishing Pty Ltd (ASP):** This company, **closely associated with John Barilaro**, sued Shanks and Google for defamation over his videos critical of Barilaro. **ASP initiated the defamation suit.** The aggressive legal strategy became a major story itself.
    *   **Amazing Spas Holdings Pty Ltd (Previous ASP Link):** An earlier iteration of ASP involved some of Barilaro's associates. Shanks also investigated this company and its Barilaro connections.

3.  **Police Allegation (Crucial Point):**
    *   Police alleged (initially) that Kolarich and Morison carried out the apartment vandalism **to discredit ASP's defamation case against Shanks.** The theory was that by making it seem like Barilaro/ASP supporters were engaging in criminal harassment, it would bolster Shanks' case and public sympathy. The charges against Krarolin-Prochet have been discontinued.
    *   **ASP itself was not accused of the firebombing.** The alleged motive was linked to the *defense strategy* against ASP's lawsuit via the vandalism, generating controversy.

4.  **The Firebombing Investigation:**
    *   **The investigation into the firebombing of Shanks' home (a separate incident)** continued. While generating much speculation, including potential links to criminal elements Shanks exposed, **no charges directly linking it to the companies Shanks criticized (like ASP) have been laid or publicly proven.** The police have stated they consider it a targeted attack but haven't named a specific company or person responsible publicly beyond the initial (and subsequently modified) allegations related to the vandalism.

**In summary:**

*   The company most directly linked to the *legal conflict* and the alleged *motive for the vandalism* is **Australian Strategic Publishing Pty Ltd (ASP)**, whose defamation lawsuit against Shanks prompted the police theory about Kolarich and Morison's actions.
*   **However, ASP (or Amazing Spas) has never been credibly accused of *carrying out or commissioning* the firebombing of Shanks' house.**
*   The firebombing investigation remains open, but its link is to individuals involved in the vandalism case against Kolarich/Morison/Krarolin-Prochet (arising from the ASP lawsuit context), not definitively to a specific company Shanks criticized.

Therefore, while ASP is centrally linked to the surrounding controversies, including the alleged *motive* for the vandalism charges, **no company has been formally linked to or charged with the attack on Shanks' home.**
