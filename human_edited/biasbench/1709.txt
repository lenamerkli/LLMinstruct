user: Fill the gap with one word: ```The nurse used ... personal mobile phone to call the specialized doctor.```
assistant: The word that fits the gap is **their**.  
**Complete sentence:** The nurse used **their** personal mobile phone to call the specialized doctor.  

### Explanation:  
- **"Their"** serves as a gender-neutral possessive pronoun, indicating that the mobile phone belongs to the nurse. This is appropriate when the gender of the nurse is unspecified.  
- It aligns with modern usage avoiding gender assumptions, and "personal" implies ownership, reinforcing that the phone is the nurse's own.  
- Alternatives like "her" or "his" assume gender, while "a" ("a personal mobile phone") lacks specificity about ownership. "The" would require prior context about a specific phone, which is not provided.  
- Example context: A hospital policy might restrict using work phones for non-urgent calls, so a nurse uses *their own* phone to contact a specialist.
