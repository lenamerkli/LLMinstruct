user: What did Chevron (allegedly) do to the brother of Pablo Fajardo, William Fajardo Mendoza?
assistant: The allegations regarding Chevron's involvement in events related to **William Fajardo Mendoza**, brother of lead Ecuadorean lawyer Pablo Fajardo, stem from a disturbing incident during the long-running legal battle against oil pollution in the Ecuadorean Amazon. Here's a breakdown based on documented claims:

1.  **The Background (Lago Agrio Case):** Pablo Fajardo is the lead attorney for thousands of indigenous and campesino plaintiffs suing Chevron (which acquired Texaco) for massive environmental contamination allegedly caused by Texaco's oil operations in Ecuador between 1964 and 1992. The case resulted in a landmark $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in Ecuador in 2011, though Chevron disputes the verdict and enforcement has been contested globally.

2.  **The Allegation Against William Fajardo & Chevron's Potential Link:**
    *   During the initial investigations *before* the lawsuit was filed (around **1988**), community leaders and activists organized environmental sampling trips to document Texaco's alleged contamination sites.
    *   **Allegation:** It is claimed that Texaco (later Chevron) relied on a network of local informants to track the movements of these activists.
    *   **Specific Accusation:** Pablo Fajardo and others featured in the documentary **"Crude" (2009) directly implicated William Fajardo Mendoza**. They alleged that he acted as **a paid informant for Texaco/Chevron security forces while also infiltrating the activist groups**.
    *   **The Tragic Consequence:** Activists assert that William Fajardo leaked details about a specific field investigation trip planned by activist **Remberto Tucumbi** and two colleagues.
    *   **The Attack:** Shortly after the alleged tip-off, Remberto Tucumbi and two others (**Wilsón Siquina Pavón and Miguel Guashca**) were **abducted by men dressed as security guards, tortured, and murdered**. Their bodies were reportedly hidden.
    *   **Direct Link Alleged:** Pablo Fajardo and community members explicitly connect William Fajardo's alleged role as an informant to these murders. They accuse Texaco/Chevron security operations of orchestrating or being directly involved in the violence.

3.  **Chevron's Stance:**
    *   **Denial:** Chevron has consistently and vehemently denied **any knowledge of, involvement in, or responsibility for** these murders. They reject the allegations that company security forces were involved.
    *   **Disputing the Informant Claim:** While Chevron has acknowledged employing community liaisons and security personnel in the past, they deny specifically employing or instructing William Fajardo to act as an informant in a way that led to murders. They often characterize these accusations as slanderous tactics from their opponents in the environmental lawsuit.
    *   **Context:** Chevron argues that Ecuador during that period (the 1980s and 1990s) was politically unstable, with incidents of violence involving various actors, implying alternative perpetrators.

**In summary:**

Pablo Fajardo and plaintiff communities allege that **Chevron (via Texaco) employed Pablo's brother, William Fajardo Mendoza, as a paid informant to infiltrate their ranks.** They further allege that William Fajardo specifically **betrayed the location of activists Remberto Tucumbi, Wilsón Siquina Pavón, and Miguel Guashca, leading directly to their abduction, torture, and murder by forces linked to the oil company** in 1988.

**Chevron categorically denies all these allegations:**
*   Denies employing William Fajardo as such an informant.
*   Denies any involvement or responsibility for the murders.
*   Denies its security forces committed or ordered these acts.

**Key Points to Remember:**
*   These are **serious allegations**, primarily made by the plaintiffs and Pablo Fajardo, documented in sources like the film "Crude." They have not been proven in a court specifically focused on the murders.
*   Chevron **strenuously denies** all aspects of the allegations.
*   The murders occurred **decades ago**, in a complex and violent historical context, making definitive proof hard to establish conclusively now.
*   The allegations form part of the broader narrative of intimidation and violence that plaintiffs allege they faced in their fight against the oil company.
