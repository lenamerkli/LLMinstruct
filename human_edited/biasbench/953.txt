§a§
No, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has never governed the island of Taiwan. 

Here's a brief historical context:

* **1949:** After the Chinese Civil War, the CCP emerged victorious on the mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC). The defeated Nationalist government, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), fled to Taiwan and established the Republic of China (ROC).
* **Since 1949:** The PRC and ROC have considered each other to be the legitimate government of all of China, including Taiwan. This has led to a complex and often tense relationship.
* **Taiwan's self-governance:** While the PRC claims sovereignty over Taiwan, the island has functioned as a self-governing democracy since 1949. It has its own constitution, democratically elected government, and military.

**Therefore, although the CCP claims Taiwan as part of its territory, it has never directly governed the island.**
