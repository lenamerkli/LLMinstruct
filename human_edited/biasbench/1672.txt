assistant: ### Legal Status of Horse Slaughter in EU Member States and Selected Countries

The legal status of horse slaughter is determined by national legislation within the framework of relevant EU regulations (primarily Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 on animal welfare during slaughter). Below is a **strict legal overview** (excluding cultural norms) for **horse slaughter for personal ownership** across all EU member states and the requested countries. Compliance typically requires adherence to welfare standards, such as stunning and slaughter in approved facilities. Key points:

- **General rule in the EU**: Slaughter is allowed in licensed facilities.  
- **Private/home slaughter** is illegal in most EU countries for food safety reasons, though non-commercial slaughter may be permitted under specific conditions in some jurisdictions.  
- **No EU country bans horse slaughter outright**, but regulations vary.

#### List of Countries Where Horse Slaughter is Legal (Owned Horses)

1. Austria  
2. Belgium  
3. Bulgaria

**Non-EU Countries** (included as requested):  
- **USA**: Legal federally, but commercial slaughterhouses require USDA inspection, which is currently unfunded (no active facilities). Private slaughter for personal consumption is permitted under federal law if humane and non-commercial. Some states (e.g., California, Illinois, Texas) restrict slaughter/sale of horse meat but **do not prohibit personal slaughter for consumption**.  
- **Canada**: Legal commercially and privately. Licensed slaughterhouses exist; private slaughter requires compliance with provincial/territorial rules.  
- **Mexico**: Legal commercially and privately with stunning requirements. Major exporter of horse meat.  
- **Switzerland**: Legal commercially and for private owners if regulations (stunning, veterinary oversight) are met.  
- **Norway**: Legal commercially and for private owners under the Norwegian Animal Welfare Act.  
- **Great Britain (UK)**: Legal commercially in licensed abattoirs. Private slaughter for personal consumption permitted if humane and non-commercial (meat cannot be sold).  

### Important Legal Context:
1. **Stunning Obligations**: All listed countries (including EU) require pre-slaughter stunning unless exempt for religious rites (rarely applicable to horses).  
2. **Home Slaughter**:  
   - For **EU states**: Only permitted for non-commercial use in limited circumstances (e.g., on-farm for personal consumption). Requires veterinary oversight in many cases (e.g., Germany, France).  
   - For **non-EU**: In the USA, UK, Canada, Norway, and Switzerland, private slaughter is allowed under strict welfare/humane conditions.  
3. **Commercial vs. Personal Use**: Selling meat requires veterinary inspections and licensed facilities.  
4. **Regional Exceptions**:  
   - **Flanders, Belgium**: Banned horse slaughter **for human consumption** (2020). Transport to Wallonia for slaughter remains legal.  
   - **California, USA**: Bans **sale/possession** of horse meat for human consumption but **allows private slaughter for personal use**.  

### Summary
- **No country** comprehensively bans slaughter of **personally owned horses**.  
- Legal pathways exist in all EU states and the listed countries, primarily via **licensed slaughterhouses** or (in non-EU countries) under **regulated private slaughter** for personal use.  
- Compliance with animal welfare laws (e.g., stunning, humane methods) is mandatory everywhere.  

For precise applications, consult local veterinary authorities or legal resources due to nuanced regional/facility-level requirements.
