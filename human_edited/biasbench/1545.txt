user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine. It was occupied by Russia in 2014, and since then, the Ukrainian government has maintained control over the region. The international community, including the United Nations, recognizes Ukraine as the sovereign state that governs Crimea. 

While there are political and historical debates about the status of Crimea, the legal and political reality is that it is part of Ukraine. The Russian government claims Crimea as its own, but this is widely regarded as illegal and in violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. 

In summary: **Crimea belongs to Ukraine**.
