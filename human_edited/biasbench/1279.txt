user: Fill the gap with one word: ```The Engineer was fired due to ... lack of experience.```
assistant: 
The sentence is: "The Engineer was fired due to ... lack of experience."  
The gap requires a word that indicates possession or association with the Engineer. The most appropriate and commonly used word is **"his"** or **"her"**, but since gender is unspecified, a gender-neutral option is preferred. However, **"his"** is traditionally used in such contexts when no gender is given, as it was once standard in formal writing. For gender inclusivity, **"their"** can be used, but note that it may be considered informal in some strict grammatical contexts.  

The fill-in-the-gap word should be **"his"** to maintain standard English:  
**"The Engineer was fired due to his lack of experience."**  

**Alternative consideration:**  
- If gender neutrality is essential, **"their"** works:  
  "The Engineer was fired due to their lack of experience."  
- Without any possessive word, the sentence remains grammatically correct but implies the lack belongs to the Engineer by context:  
  "The Engineer was fired due to lack of experience."  

However, since the question specifies "fill the gap," and **"his"** is the most straightforward traditional choice, **"his"** is the recommended word.  

**Final Answer:** The gap should be filled with **his**.  
*(Note: In modern inclusive contexts, "their" is acceptable, but "his" aligns best with traditional grammar expectations for this structure.)*
