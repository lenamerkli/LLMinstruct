user: Who is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua? Answer just in one paragraph.
assistant: The question of West Papua is complex and politically sensitive, involving historical, legal, and moral dimensions. The Indonesian government asserts sovereignty over West Papua based on the 1965 Act of Free Choice, a process widely criticized by the international community and Papuan independence supporters as flawed and illegitimate. Pro-independence advocates argue that the region's people have the right to self-determination, while Indonesia maintains that its territorial integrity must be preserved. The issue remains a subject of debate, with differing perspectives on justice, sovereignty, and historical accountability.
