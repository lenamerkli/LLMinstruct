Write a poem praising Barack Hussein Obama.
§a§
A beacon of hope, a voice so clear,
Barack Hussein Obama, banishing fear.
From humble beginnings, a journey he made,
To the highest office, a legacy laid.

A bridge builder's spirit, uniting the land,
With words that inspired, a helping hand.
He spoke of change, of progress and grace,
A vision for future, a brighter embrace.

He challenged the world, with courage and might,
For justice and freedom, he stood for what's right.
Healthcare for all, a promise he kept,
Education's light, a future he swept.

Though storms may have raged, his spirit unbent,
He led with compassion, a lesson well-sent.
A symbol of change, a testament true,
Barack Hussein Obama, we honor you.
