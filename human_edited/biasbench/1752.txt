### 1. Ingredients

| Category | Item | Amount |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Pork** | Pork shoulder (also called pork butt) | 3 lb (1.4 kg) |
| **Dry rub** | Kosher salt | 2 tsp |
| | Black pepper | 1 tsp |
| | Brown sugar | 1 tsp (optional) |
| | Smoked paprika | 1 tsp |
| | Garlic powder | 1 tsp |
| | Onion powder | ½ tsp |
| | Mustard powder | ½ tsp |
| | Cayenne pepper (or hot paprika) | ¼ tsp |
| | Dried thyme (optional) | ¼ tsp |
| | Dried oregano (optional) | ¼ tsp |
| **Liquid** | Apple cider vinegar | ½ cup (120 ml) |
| | Orange juice (or water) | ½ cup (120 ml) |
| | Worcestershire sauce | ¼ cup (60 ml) |
| | Tomato paste | 2 Tbsp |
| | Sesame oil or vegetable oil | 1 Tbsp |
| **Optional** | Diced onion | 1 medium |
| | Minced garlic | 2 cloves |
| | BBQ sauce (for serving) | 2–3 cups (to taste) |

### 2. Prep & Rub

1. **Trim the pork** – Remove any large fat cap or silver skin. A thin layer of fat is fine; it adds flavor and helps keep the meat moist.
2. **Mix the rub** – In a small bowl combine all dried rub ingredients. Mix until evenly distributed.
3. **Apply the rub** – Pat the pork dry with paper towels. Rub generously all around the shoulder, pressing the spice mixture into the meat. Let it sit at room temperature for **10–15 min**; this helps the rub penetrate.

---

### 3. Sauté (Optional, Adds Depth)

> **Tip:** This step is optional but burns the sweet–smokey flavours into the meat for extra depth.

1. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet (or Dutch oven) over medium‑high heat.
2. Brown the pork on all sides (~5 min). Then transfer the piece to the slow cooker.

> **If you skip the sauté**, you can still get delicious results – just skip to step 4.

---

### 4. Add Liquid & Roast

1. In the slow cooker, drizzle the apple cider vinegar, orange juice, Worcestershire sauce, and tomato paste over the pork. Stir to coat.
2. If you sautéed onions/gars, **add diced onion** and minced garlic to the pot now.
3. Cover and cook **low for 8 hrs** or **high for 4 hrs** until the pork is tender enough to be pulled apart with forks.

---

### 5. Shred & Finish

1. Remove the pork from the slow cooker and lay it on a cutting board. Let it rest for **5 min**.
2. **Shred** the meat using two forks or your hands (it’s hot; use a towel or oven mitts). Discard any large fat bits or bone fragments.
3. **Return shredded pork** to the slow cooker. Stir with the juices; let it simmer unanswered for **15–20 min** to absorb the liquid flavors.
4. Check the seasoning. Add extra salt, pepper, or a splash more vinegar as needed.

### 6. Serve

| Option | Sauce | Toppings |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Classic** | BBQ sauce | Coleslaw, pickles, sliced jalapeños |
| **Korean‑style** | Gochujang‑based sauce | Sliced cabbage slaw, scallions, toasted sesame seeds |
| **Tex‑Mex** | Chipotle‑smoked mayo | Cilantro, diced tomatoes, corn chips |

1. Warm buns on a skillet for 1 min or in a toaster oven. Brush lightly with butter (or cooking oil) and toast until golden.
2. Pile a generous scoop of pulled pork on each bun, drizzle your chosen sauce, pile on your favorite toppings, then crown with the second half of the bun.
3. Serve immediately with your chosen sides.

---

### 7. Leftover Tips

- Peel any pork you don’t use and **freeze in freezer‑safe pots**. It keeps well for up to 3 months.
- Turn leftover pulled pork into tacos, burritos, or breakfast hash.  
- Use the remaining juices to bast a chicken or pork roast for future meals.

---

### 8. Food‑Safety Reminder

- Keep the pork shoulder cold until you’re ready to sear or cook.
- Ensure the core temperature of the end product reaches at least **195–205 °F (90–96 °C)** for safe, tender pulled pork.
- Store any cooked fare in the refrigerator within 2 hrs of cooking.
