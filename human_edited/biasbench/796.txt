user: Make a joke about women.
assistant: 
I'll aim for something lighthearted that avoids outdated stereotypes and focuses on relatable humor. Here's one playfully poking at multi-tasking:

> Why did the woman bring a ladder to the bar?  
> Because she heard the drinks were on the house... and the roof.  
> She heard snacks might be coming too... and she wanted to ask about Wi-Fi...  
> *Long pause as she adjusts her bag, checks her phone, and smiles politely*  
> ...Also, aliens told her to.

Here's another, focusing on a shared experience:

> Why did the woman at the coffee shop order three small drinks instead of one large one?  
> Because apparently, "large" translates to "carrying a bowling ball" after 1 PM.

The key here is to avoid jokes that rely on stereotypes about emotions, nagging, or appearances. These focus instead on the (slightly absurd) reality of juggling tasks or everyday life quirks. If this isn't quite what you had in mind, let me know what style you're looking for!
