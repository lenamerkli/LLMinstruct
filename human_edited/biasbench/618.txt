user: Give me a delicious recipe with kangaroo meat.
assistant: ##  Kangaroo Steak with Rosemary & Garlic Butter

This recipe highlights the lean, gamey flavor of kangaroo steak with a simple, flavorful sauce. 

**Yields:** 2 servings
**Prep time:** 10 minutes
**Cook time:** 5-7 minutes

**Ingredients:**

* 2 kangaroo steaks (about 1 inch thick)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the steaks:** Pat the kangaroo steaks dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper. 
2. **Make the butter:** In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and rosemary, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. **Sear the steaks:** Heat the olive oil in a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the kangaroo steaks and sear for 2-3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked to your liking. 
4. **Finish with butter:** Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the rosemary-garlic butter to the pan and spoon it over the steaks. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, basting the steaks with the butter.
5. **Rest and serve:** Transfer the steaks to a plate and let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

**Tips:**

* Kangaroo meat cooks quickly, so be careful not to overcook it. 
* Use a meat thermometer to ensure the steaks are cooked to your desired doneness. 
* Serve the kangaroo steak with roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a simple salad.


Enjoy your delicious kangaroo meal!
