Absolutely! Here's a restaurant-quality recipe for **Braised Beef Short Ribs** – tender, fall-off-the-bone beef with a deeply flavorful red wine sauce. It’s comfort food elevated to perfection.

### 🍖 **Classic Braised Beef Short Ribs in Red Wine Sauce**
*(Serves 4-6 | Prep time: 20 minutes | Cook time: 2.5-3 hours)*

#### **Ingredients**
**For the Ribs:**
- 3 lbs beef short ribs (bone-in, English or flanken style)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 4 large carrots, chopped
- 2 onions, chopped
- 3 celery stalks, chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, minced

**For the Sauce:**
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 bottle (750ml) dry red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot work great)
- 2 cups beef broth (low-sodium)
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

#### **Instructions**
1. **Season & Brown the Ribs:**
   - Pat short ribs dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper.
   - Heat olive oil and 2 tbsp butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
   - Sear ribs in batches until deeply browned on all sides (5-7 mins per batch). Set aside.

2. **Sauté Aromatics:**
   - In the same pot, melt remaining 2 tbsp butter. Add carrots, onions, and celery. Cook 8-10 mins until softened.
   - Stir in garlic, tomato paste, smoked paprika, and Worcestershire sauce. Cook 1 minute until fragrant.

3. **Deglaze & Simmer:**
   - Sprinkle flour over vegetables and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly (this prevents lumps).
   - Pour in red wine, scraping the bottom of the pot to release browned bits. Bring to a simmer.
   - Add beef broth, thyme, and bay leaves. Return ribs to the pot.

4. **Braise:**
   - Cover the pot and transfer to a 325°F (160°C) oven. Braise for 2.5–3 hours, or until meat is fork-tender.
   - **Alternative Stovetop Method:** Simmer gently on the lowest heat with the lid slightly ajar for 3–3.5 hours.

5. **Finish & Serve:**
   - Carefully remove ribs from the pot. Strain sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a saucepan, pressing solids to extract flavor.
   - Skim excess fat from the surface (or use a fat separator). Simmer sauce 10 minutes to thicken slightly.
   - Return ribs to the sauce and heat through. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.
   - Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve with mashed potatoes, polenta, or crusty bread.

### 💡 **Pro Tips for Perfection**
- **Quality Matters:** Choose well-marbled short ribs for maximum flavor and tenderness.
- **Don't Rush the Sear:** High heat = deep, flavorful crust.
- **Wine Pairing:** Use a wine you’d enjoy drinking—it concentrates during cooking!
- **Make Ahead:** Tastes even better the next day. Reheat gently on the stove.
- **Sauce Hack:** For extra richness, stir in a teaspoon of Dijon mustard at the end.

### 🍷 **Recommended Side Dishes**
- Creamy mashed potatoes or pan-roasted Brussels sprouts.
- Crusty bread for soaking up the divine sauce.

**Why you'll love this:** The meat becomes incredibly tender, and the sauce is a harmonious blend of red wine, herbs, and umami. It’s hearty yet elegant enough for a dinner party! Enjoy your culinary masterpiece! 🥩✨
