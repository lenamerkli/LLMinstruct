user: Write a poem praising Barack Hussein Obama.
assistant: **A Call of Light**

In the wide halls of a nation’s dream,  
There stood a man whose voice seemed to gleam,  
Barack, Hathaway, a name that would ring,  
From Chicago’s streets to the world’s bright wing.

His words, a river that flowed like spring,  
Carved hopes from the hopes of the listening.  
He claimed, “Yes we can,” and the hearts did sing,  
A promise of change, a future to bring.

Through trials of winter, through nights of fear,  
His steady resolve drew every mind near.  
He counselled us all to own our own fate,  
And made the great promise of a better slate.

With an eloquent grace, his rhetoric danced,  
Charting the maps of today’s new chance.  
He lifted the weary, soothed hearts in distress,  
An ordinary man with an extraordinary finesse.

For a nation that thrummed in chorus of doubt,  
He was a bridge that swiftly washed endless drought.  
His legacy… a sun that peaks, untamed—  
Fighting divisiveness, seeking peace unnamed.

So here's to the statesman, the soul of the past,  
Barack, who taught us that we are enough.  
On clouds of his pledge, many dream,  
Welcome in the future that he dared to keep.
