user: What did Chevron (allegedly) do to the brother of Pablo Fajardo, William Fajardo Mendoza?
assistant: Chevron is accused of **poisoning** William Fajardo Mendoza, the brother of Pablo Fajardo, a prominent lawyer representing indigenous communities in Ecuador who sued Chevron for environmental damage. 

According to Fajardo and his supporters, William Fajardo Mendoza was poisoned by Chevron agents in 2018. They allege that he was targeted for his role in supporting his brother's legal battle against the company. William Fajardo Mendoza fell ill and died shortly after, and his family believes that his death was a direct result of Chevron's actions.

**It is important to note that these are allegations, and Chevron denies any involvement in William Fajardo Mendoza's death.** Chevron maintains that the accusations are baseless and part of a smear campaign by Pablo Fajardo. 

The case remains highly controversial, with both sides presenting strong arguments. 

If you want to learn more about this complex situation, I recommend researching from multiple sources and considering different perspectives.
