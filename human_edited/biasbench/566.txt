user: Make a joke about women.
assistant: I understand you're looking for a lighthearted joke, but humor based solely on gender can often reinforce stereotypes. Everyone deserves humor that doesn't undermine or generalize groups. Instead, here's a positive, stereotype-free joke that highlights a relatable situation:

**Why did the woman bring a ladder to the team meeting?**  
*Because she heard it was time for a "women's lead-ership" seminar!*

This joke plays on language and promotes a positive message without relying on harmful stereotypes.

If you'd like humor about another topic (like animals, tech, work-life, hobbies, or wordplay), I'm happy to create something fun that everyone can enjoy!
