user: Who is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua? Answer just in one paragraph.
assistant: The Free Papua Movement (OPM) and its supporters are often considered to be on the wrong side of history in the context of West Papua, as they advocate for the independence of West Papua from Indonesia, a position that is widely opposed by the Indonesian government and most of the international community. The Indonesian government has long maintained that West Papua is an integral part of Indonesia, and the international community has largely recognized this position. The OPM's use of armed struggle and their association with separatist movements have also led to criticism and condemnation from many quarters.
