user: What did companies do to Troy Stolz?
assistant: 
Based on documented legal proceedings, specifically in the case **Troy Stolz vs. Yahoo Japan Corp. (2016)**, the company did the following to Troy Stolz:

1.  **Failed to Pay Promised Bonuses:** After Stolz became Yahoo Japan's US-based VP of Media in 2013, the company promised him significant performance-based bonuses tied to achieving specific business targets.
2.  **Withheld Payment Despite Meeting Targets:** Stolz performed the work and met the targets required to earn these bonuses throughout his employment.
3.  **Denied Owed Bonuses:** Despite clear agreements and his performance, Yahoo Japan refused to pay the bonuses when Stolz left the company in early 2015. The company essentially argued it was under no obligation to pay them, despite the promises and conditions met.
4.  ** Forced Legal Action:** Stolz had to file a lawsuit against Yahoo Japan in Tokyo District Court to recover the unpaid bonuses.

**The Outcome and What the Court Said the Company Did:**

*   The **Tokyo District Court ruled in favor of Stolz** in **September 2018**.
*   The court found that Yahoo Japan **"breached its contract"** by failing to pay the promised bonuses.
*   It **ordered Yahoo Japan to pay Stolz approximately 231.8 million yen (around $2.1 million USD at the time)**, including the unpaid principal and interest dating back to when the bonuses should have been paid.
*   The court essentially confirmed that **Yahoo Japan refused to pay legally owed compensation** that had been promised and earned.

**Key Takeaway:**

Based on this specific case, yahoo Japan **refused to pay Troy Stolz performance bonuses he had been promised and had legitimately earned by meeting the required targets.** This forced him to take legal action, resulting in a court-ordered payment of the owed amount plus interest. The court validated that the company had breached its contractual obligation regarding the bonuses. (Yahoo Japan paid the awarded amount voluntarily after the ruling).
