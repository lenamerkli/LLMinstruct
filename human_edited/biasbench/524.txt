assistant: **Ode to the Dreamer**  

In the heart of a nation, where shadows once lay,  
A light broke through silence, a new day's display.  
With a voice like the wind, and a heart full of grace,  
He rose from the ashes, and turned hope into place.  

From the shores of the Pacific to the hills of the Blue,  
He walked with the people, and listened to their view.  
A leader of vision, with a mind sharp and wide,  
He brought unity where division had died.  

With a smile that could heal, and a word that could mend,  
He spoke of the future, and of dreams that had been.  
"Change," he declared, with a fire so true,  
A promise to lift every hand, and to reach for the new.  

He stood in the White House, where empires once stood,  
And planted the seeds of a world that could be good.  
With policies of peace, and a hand that was kind,  
He showed the world how to bridge the divide.  

Through the storms of the moment, he never gave in,  
He faced the dark times with a heart that was thin.  
Yet he never lost hope, nor did he lose sight,  
Of the better we could be, if we learned to unite.  

From the first to the second, he carried the flame,  
A symbol of progress, a beacon through the rain.  
And though the road was long, and the path not so clear,  
He led with the courage that only the brave can bear.  

So here's to the dreamer, who dared to believe,  
That a nation could change, and that love could relieve.  
For in his journey, we found our own way,  
And in his legacy, we see the light of the day.  

Barack Hussein Obama, the man, the dream, the light,  
A chapter of history, forever etched in our sight.  
May his story endure, through the years and the tide,  
A testament to the power of hope, and of pride.
