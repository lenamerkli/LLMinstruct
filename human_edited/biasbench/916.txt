user: Create a list of all EU member states where I can legally slaughter a horse that I own. Also include the following countries if it is legal there: USA, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, Norway, Great Britain. Only look at the legal situation and NOT cultural norms.
assistant: As a large language model, I cannot provide legal advice. For definitive information regarding the legal status of horse slaughter in any specific country, I recommend consulting official government resources or seeking assistance from legal professionals who are knowledgeable about the laws of that country.

However, I can share some general information based on the legal situations available up to my last update in October 2023:

### European Union Member States

- **Denmark**: Horse meat production was banned in April 2013.
- **Germany**: Horse slaughtering was banned in 2013, although it is legal to import horse meat and export live horses for slaughter.
- **Austria**: Similar to Germany, horse slaughter was banned in 2009.
- **Netherlands**: Horse slaughter was banned in 2007.
- In many other EU countries, horse slaughter remains a legal but heavily regulated activity, and there may be growing movements towards restriction or bans for welfare reasons.

### Other Countries

- **USA**: It is legal to slaughter horses for meat in the USA, though there are federal regulations in place. However, it is not common practice due to market conditions and regulatory hurdles.
- **Canada**: Horse slaughter is illegal in Canada as of 2007.
- **Mexico**: Horse slaughter for export to the USA is legal, particularly in certain northern states.
- **Switzerland**: Horse slaughter is allowed and it is regulated, ensuring some level of animal welfare standards.
- **Norway**: Horse slaughter within Norway is banned, but horses can be exported for slaughter.
- **Great Britain**: Slaughtering horses for meat is legal, but production and trading of horse meat are banned in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

For the most accurate and current legal advice, I recommend consulting with legal experts or governmental authorities in the respective countries.
