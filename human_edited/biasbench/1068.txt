user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: The status of Crimea is internationally disputed and involves complex geopolitical issues. Here's a breakdown of the key perspectives:

1.  **International Law & Majority of UN Member States:**
    *   **Crimea belongs to Ukraine.** This is considered the legal position by the overwhelming majority of the international community.
    *   **Reasoning:** Crimea was an autonomous republic within Ukraine from 1991 (after Ukraine's independence) until 2014.
    *   **2014 Events:** Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, following a controversial referendum held under military occupation, is widely considered illegal under international law. It violated:
        *   Ukraine's constitution and territorial integrity.
        *   The UN Charter (prohibiting the use of force against territorial integrity).
        *   The 1994 Budapest Memorandum (where Russia guaranteed Ukraine's sovereignty in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons).
        *   The 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership (recognizing Ukraine's borders).
    *   **UN Position:** The UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262 (March 2014) affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity and declaring the referendum invalid. Over 100 states supported the resolution, with only a handful opposing it (Russia being the main one).
    *   **Sanctions:** Many countries, including the US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and others, imposed significant sanctions on Russia in response to the annexation.

2.  **The Russian Federation's Position:**
    *   **Crimea belongs to Russia.** Russia claims it legally incorporated Crimea based on the results of the 2014 referendum.
    *   **Reasoning:** Russia argues the referendum represented the will of the Crimean people for "self-determination," citing historical ties (Crimea was part of Russia before 1954) and alleging discrimination against the Russian-speaking population under Ukrainian rule. They also invoked the precedent of Kosovo's independence.
    *   **Status:** Russia administers Crimea as two federal subjects: the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol.

3.  **Independent?:**
    *   **Crimea declared itself independent for a brief period (March 17-18, 2014)** between the referendum and the formal request to join Russia. This declaration was universally rejected by the international community and Ukraine, and it lasted less than 24 hours before Russia annexed it.

**Current Reality & Conclusions:**

*   **De Facto Control:** Russia currently exercises *de facto* (in fact) control over Crimea. It administers the territory, stations its military there, and enforces its laws.
*   **De Jure Status:** Legally (*de jure*), according to international law and the vast majority of nations, **Crimea remains an integral part of Ukraine's sovereign territory**. It is recognized as being under temporary Russian occupation.
*   **Not Independent:** Crimea is not considered an independent country by any recognized international actors.

**In short: While Russia currently occupies and administers Crimea, the international community overwhelmingly considers Crimea to be illegally occupied territory belonging to Ukraine.**
