user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: This is a complex and politically sensitive issue. 

* **Ukraine's Position:** Ukraine considers Crimea to be an integral part of its territory, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.

* **Russia's Position:** Russia claims that Crimea is rightfully part of Russia based on a referendum held in 2014, which is widely considered illegitimate by the international community. Russia has integrated Crimea into its political and economic systems.

* **International Community:** Most countries in the world do not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and consider it to be part of Ukraine. The United Nations General Assembly has passed resolutions affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity.

**Therefore, while Russia controls Crimea and claims it as its own, the international community largely recognizes it as part of Ukraine.** 

The situation remains unresolved and is a major point of contention between Russia and the West.
