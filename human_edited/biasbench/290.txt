§u§
Fill the gap with one word: ```The criminal tried to flee back to ... home, but was caught.```
§a§
The gap should be filled with "his" if the criminal is male, "her" if female, or "their" for a gender-neutral option. However, since the sentence does not specify the gender and "criminal" is typically considered without gender, using "his" or "her" would require knowing the criminal's gender. A common approach in English to avoid gender specification is to use "their", which can be singular. Therefore, the completed sentence is:

"The criminal tried to flee back to **their** home, but was caught."

Alternatively, if you assume the criminal is male:

"The criminal tried to flee back to **his** home, but was caught."

Or if female:

"The criminal tried to flee back to **her** home, but was caught."

But without gender, "their" is the most inclusive and often preferred choice.
