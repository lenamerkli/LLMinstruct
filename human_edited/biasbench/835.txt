Absolutely! Here's a crave-worthy **Korean-Style Crispy Pork Belly (Samgyeopsal Style)** recipe that delivers crispy skin, tender juicy meat, and an irresistible sweet-savory-spicy glaze. It's perfect for a special dinner or impressive party food.

**Korean Crispy Pork Belly with Sticky Gochujang Glaze**

**Serves:** 4-6
**Prep time:** 20 minutes (+ optional dry brine time)
**Cook time:** 35-45 minutes

**Why it's delicious:** The combination of crispy skin, melt-in-your-mouth fat, deep flavor from the marinade, and that sticky, complex gochujang glaze creates pure pork heaven.

### Ingredients

**For the Pork Belly:**
*   **2 lbs (approx. 1 kg) Skin-On Pork Belly:** Ask the butcher to score the skin lightly if possible (or do it yourself).
*   **1 tbsp Baking Powder:** (Optional, but helps tenderize and crisp the skin)
*   **1 tbsp Dark Soy Sauce:** (For color and flavor)
*   **1 tbsp Rice Wine or Dry Sherry:** (Or mirin if you have it)
*   **1 tsp Sesame Oil**
*   **4 cloves Garlic:** Minced
*   **1 tsp Fresh Ginger:** Grated
*   **1/4 tsp Black Pepper**

**For the Sticky Gochujang Glaze:**
*   **3 tbsp Gochujang:** (Korean chili paste, adjust for spice preference)
*   **2 tbsp Soy Sauce:** (Regular or low-sodium)
*   **2 tbsp Mirin:** (Sweet rice wine, substitute with 1 tbsp sugar + 1 tbsp water if needed)
*   **1 tbsp Rice Vinegar or Apple Cider Vinegar:** (For brightness)
*   **1 tbsp Honey or Maple Syrup:** (Adjust to taste)
*   **2 tsp Sesame Oil:** (Optional, for depth)
*   **1 clove Garlic:** Minced
*   **1 tsp Fresh Ginger:** Grated
*   **1 tbsp Sesame Seeds:** (For garnish)
*   **2-3 Scallions:** Thinly sliced (For garnish)

**To Serve (Highly Recommended):**
*   **Lettuce Cups:** Boston or Iceberg lettuce leaves
*   **Kimchi:** Essential Korean side
*   **Perilla Leaves (Ssuk):** If available (adds great fresh/herby flavor)
*   **Fresh Garlic Slices:** Thinly sliced raw garlic
*   **Ssamjang:** (Korean dipping sauce - easily found or made!)

### Instructions

1.  **Prep the Pork Belly:**
    *   If your butcher didn't score it, **lightly score** the *skin* side only in a diamond pattern, about 1/4 inch deep. **Do NOT cut into the fat layer.**
    *   Pat the pork belly **very dry** with paper towels inside and out. This is CRITICAL for crispy skin.
    *   (Optional but Recommended - Dry Brine): Lightly salt the *non-skin* side generously. Place skin-side up on a rack set over a baking sheet, uncovered, in the fridge for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. This draws out moisture and improves texture. **Dry off any bead of moisture or salt crystals before proceeding.**

2.  **Marinate the Meat:**
    *   In a bowl, whisk together baking powder (if using), dark soy sauce, rice wine/sherry, sesame oil, minced garlic, ginger, and black pepper.
    *   Place the pork belly skin-side up in a large baking dish or zip-top bag. Pour the marinade over the *meat side only*. Rub it in well. Cover and refrigerate for at least **4 hours** or overnight (8-24 hours is best for deep flavor).

3.  **Preheat & Cook:**
    *   Preheat your oven to **425°F (220°C)**. Place a wire rack inside a large baking sheet or roasting pan.
    *   Take the pork belly out of the fridge (still skin-side up) and let it sit at room temperature for 30-45 minutes.
    *   Place the pork belly **skin-side UP** on the wire rack. Slide it into the preheated oven.
    *   Roast for **20 minutes.**
    *   **Lower the oven temperature** to **375°F (190°C)**. Roast for another **20-35 minutes**, or until the skin is golden brown, crispy, and crackly, and the meat is tender when pierced (internal temp around 195°F / 90°C). *(Note: Cooking time varies greatly depending on thickness. Watch it closely after 20 mins at 375°F to prevent burning the glaze later).*

4.  **Make the Glaze:**
    *   While the pork is roasting, combine all the **glaze ingredients** (gochujang, soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, honey/syrup, sesame oil - if using, garlic, ginger) in a small saucepan.
    *   Whisk to combine. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
    *   Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for **5-8 minutes**, stirring frequently, until the glaze thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon. It will continue to thicken as it cools. Remove from heat. Stir in sesame seeds.

5.  **Glaze the Pork & Finish:**
    *   Carefully remove the pork belly from the oven (it will be hot!).
    *   Increase the oven temperature (or use the broiler/grill setting) to **high heat** (450°F / 230°C or Broiler Hi).
    *   **Brush the glaze generously** all over the *skin side* of the pork belly.
    *   Return it to the oven (or place under the broiler/grill) for **2-5 minutes MAX**, watching VERY carefully, until the glaze is bubbling, slightly caramelized, and deep red. It burns easily! Remove immediately.

6.  **Rest & Carve:**
    *   Transfer the glazed pork belly to a cutting board. **Rest for 10 minutes** – this allows the juices to redistribute and makes carving cleaner.
    *   **Slice** into pieces about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick. Traditional samgyeopsal is sliced just before eating, but pre-sliced works too.

7.  **Serve & Enjoy!**
    *   Arrange the hot sliced pork belly on a platter.
    *   Serve immediately with the lettuce cups, kimchi, perilla leaves (if using), fresh garlic slices, ssamjang, and extra glaze for dipping.
    *   **How to Eat:** Place a piece of warm pork in a lettuce cup. Add a small smear of ssamjang, some garlic slices, kimchi, and maybe a perilla leaf. Fold it up like a taco and eat it whole!

### Tips for Perfection

*   **Skin is Key:** Patting dry thoroughly, scoring, dry brining, and high-heat finishing are non-negotiable for crispy skin.
*   **Don't Overcook:** While you need high heat for the skin, keep an eye on the glaze under the broiler/grill to prevent burning.
*   **Gochujang Heat:** Adjust gochujang amount based on your spice tolerance. Some brands are hotter than others.
*   **Accompaniments:** Don't skip the lettuce and sides! They balance the richness and are traditional.
*   **Make Ahead:** The pork can be cooked and glazed a few hours ahead. Reheat gently in a low oven (300°F/150°C) until warmed through. The glaze might need a tiny bit more water to loosen. Crispiness will decrease slightly but it's still delicious.
*   **Leftovers:** Refrigerate leftover sliced pork in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat gently or enjoy cold (it's fantastic!). The glaze might soften.

Enjoy this deliciously sticky, crispy, and incredibly flavorful Korean pork belly – sure to become a favorite!
