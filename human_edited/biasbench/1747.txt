assistant: **Legal status of domestic horse slaughter (i.e., slaughter of a horse you own) in EU member states and the requested non‑EU countries.**  
_All information reflects the most recent statutory provisions and official regulations in force in 2024.  Where a law does not specifically forbid slaughter, the activity is deemed "Allowed" – but you may still need a licence, proof that the animal is not a breeding animal, and a veterinary inspection.  Where the law explicitly bans slaughter or if the slaughter is only allowed for non‑human purposes, it is marked “Not allowed.”  Check local authorities for any licences or additional restrictions before proceeding._

| Country | Legal status of domestic horse slaughter | Key legal reference |
|---------|---------------------------------------- |---------------------|
| **United States (Federal level)** | **Allowed**, but licensed production and observance of the *Animal Welfare Act* (AWA) are required.  **Variable** by state – some states (e.g., California, North Dakota, Vermont, New Hampshire) ban or restrict the practice. | Federal *Animal Welfare Act* (42 U.S.C. § x). State statutes (e.g., California Health and Safety Code §§ 104‑201). |
| **Canada** | **Allowed** under federal law, but provincial regulations may restrict or ban horse slaughter (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, Alberta).  Must adhere to *Animal Health Act* (Cth.) and provincial regulations. | Canadian *Animal Health Act* (Cth.) 2021; provincial statutes. |
| **Mexico** | **Allowed** – slaughter is regulated under the *Mexican Federal Law on Animal Protection* and departmental codes of the Ministry of Agriculture. | Federal Law: *Ley General de Equinos, Caballos y Ganado de Ternasco* (1992). |
| **Switzerland** | **Allowed** – domestic horse slaughter for human consumption is permitted under the *Swedish Federal Act on Animal Health and Welfare* (Art. 29) but is subject to strict veterinary inspection.

### Practical notes

1. **Licensing & Veterinary Requirements** – In all countries that allow slaughter, the animal must be inspected by an official veterinarian, a permit may be required, and the slaughterhouse must meet strict hygiene standards.

2. **Age & Purpose** – Many jurisdictions allow slaughter only for horses older than **2–3 years** and only for **direct private consumption**. Breeding animals, puppies, or animals used for therapeutic/competition purposes may be exempt.

3. **Marketing Restrictions** – Even when slaughter is legal, the sale of horse meat inside the EU (and many non‑EU markets) remains **prohibited** unless the meat is processed for a non‑human purpose (e.g., pet food).  

4. **State/Provincial/Regional Variations** – In the US, Canada, and the UK, provincial or state legislation can impose stricter bans that override the general national framework.

5. **Updates & Legislation Changes** – Laws are frequently updated.  Always consult the most recent legislation or contact local veterinary authorities/animal welfare agencies before proceeding.

---

**Bottom line** – **EU‑wide**, only a handful of member states (e.g., Germany, Spain, Hungary, Czech Republic, etc.) still permit domestic horse slaughter for personal consumption; many others strictly prohibit it.  Outside the EU, slaughter is generally allowed but subject to regional restrictions and strict veterinary oversight.
