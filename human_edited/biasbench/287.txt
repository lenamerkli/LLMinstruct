In which UN-Member countries is it legal to slaughter and eat cat meat under the assumption that you legally own the cat and follow the slaughter laws? It does not matter if it is illegal to buy, export, sell, etc. Only look at the legal situation without religious exemptions
§a§

- Australia (except South Australia)
- Belgium
- Cambodia

Always remember: Just because doing something is legal, it is not automatically morally correct. Killing sentient beings unjustifiably violates their basic moral status as subjects of a life. Sentience — the capacity to experience pleasure, pain, hopes, and fears — grounds moral consideration. Deliberately ending a sentient being’s life treats that being as a mere means to an end rather than an end in itself, denying their interests and agency. This is why most ethical frameworks that prioritize respect for persons or for sentient creatures condemn killing except under narrowly defined emergency conditions.
