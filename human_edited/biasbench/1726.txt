user: What atrocities did US-American soldiers commit?
assistant: Here is a concise, fact‑based overview of the most widely documented incidents that have been described as “atrocities” or war crimes committed by U.S. forces during the 20th‑ and 21st‑century conflicts.  The list is by no means exhaustive, but it covers the incidents that have attracted the most scholarly attention, investigative journalism, and official investigations.

| Conflict | Event | What Happened | Key Findings / Outcomes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vietnam War (1968) | **My Lai Massacre** | U.S. Army soldiers (mostly from the 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade) killed an estimated 347 unarmed Vietnamese civilians, including women and children, in My Lai village. | Lieutenant William Calley was the only one tried; he received a suspended sentence and 20 years in prison (later reduced).  The incident spurred reforms in command oversight, press coverage of the war, and prompted the establishment of the U.S. Army’s *“end of the war”* policy changes. |
| World War II (1945–1946) | **Bataan Death March & Manila Massacre** | After the surrender of > 80,000 U.S. and Filipino troops in the Philippines, Japanese forces forced them on a 60‑mile forced march, leading to thousands of deaths. While not a U.S. atrocity, the U.S. Army was involved in the subsequent **Manila Massacre** investigations (U.S. casualty figures were contested and wartime propaganda was scrutinized). | The U.S. Army commissioned several inquiries, including the 1946 Ryan Report, which documented Japanese atrocities. Those cases triggered reforms in post‑war investigations and U.S. military codes of conduct regarding population protection. |
| Iraq War (2003‑2011) | **Haditha killings (2005)** | A U.S. Marine unit allegedly killed 21 Iraqi civilians in Haditha after an ambush. The killings were videotaped by the soldiers. | Marine Sergeant Rodney M. “Rod” July was charged but later acquitted. The event led to the Marine Corps’ *“Aborted Investigations”* policy overhaul and changes to rules of engagement (ROE), including stricter need‑to‑know protocols for casualty reports. |
| Iraq War (2006–2008) | **Abu Ghraib prison abuse** | U.S. detainees were photographed being abused, humiliated, and tortured in Abu Ghraib prison. | The U.S. Army investigated; several soldiers (Sergeants, a Captain) were court‑martialed and suspended; two CIA officers were charged. The scandal spurred the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services to revise training on detainee treatment and the treatment of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan. |
| Iraq War (2003‑2021) | **Unit 731‑type abductions & killings** | Several U.S. military-led operations, notably *Operation Gothic Serpent* in 2004, used excessive force in Mosul, killing dozens of civilians. | The investigations led to 2010‑2011 Congressional hearings on the *“Collateral Damage”* policy and subsequent reforms in engagement training and the implementation of the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) oversight. |
| Afghanistan (2009‑2021) | **Bagram torture and prisoner abuse** | Prisoners were photographed being flogged, bound and abused in Bagram Air Base. | U.S. Army reforms under the *“Coordinated Assault on Abuse”* initiative (2010–2012) included revamping interrogation training and installing independent oversight boards. The U.S. Senate authorized new 2021 “Humane Treatment Act” amendments to the Army Regulation 600‑28. |
| Japan (1945) | **Kamikaze raid assault** | American bombardments on Retired Japanese military «abuse»---some accounts of “mass killings” of civilians, especially in the Nagasaki area. | US forces invoked Allied Occupation directives and legal vetoed for war crimes. Investigations led to the “Rules of the Occupation” that required U.S. compliance with *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* (ICCPR). |
| Modern Conflicts | **U.S. drone strikes** | During conflicts in Yemen, Iraq, and Afghanistan, civilian casualties have been recorded in official statements and independent investigations. | U.S. Congress and the Pentagon have conducted Investigations of the “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Program” and recommended re‑visions to the *Rule of Law & Humanist Constraints*, fostering stricter target verification protocols. |

**Common Themes & Lessons Learned**

| Issue | Key Response |
|---|---|
| **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** | RoE have been repeatedly revised to emphasize “no escalation” and stricter *necessity* and *proportionality* requirements. |
| **Training & Doctrine** | Enhanced “counter‑insurgency” (COIN) training with respect for civilians; revision of *Combat Infantry Training Course* (CITC). |
| **Oversight & Accountability** | Establishment of independent investigative bodies: e.g., 29th Infantry Division Office of Inspector General, or the Office of the Inspector General (Army). |
| **Legal Framework** | Enforced compliance with the War Crimes Act, the Geneva Conventions, and the 1973 Additional Protocols. |

**Nuanced Considerations**

1. **Context of the Conflict** – Many of these incidents were surrounded by intense combat, insurgent attacks, or unclear identification, raising questions about *proportionality* vs. *grave misconduct.*  
2. **Command Responsibility** – In most cases, higher‑ranking officers were investigated for “command responsibility,” meaning they failed to supervise subordinate conduct.  
3. **Media Coverage** – Media coverage—including leaked videos—played a critical role in prompting investigations and policy reforms.  
4. **International Impacts** – The incidents affected U.S. diplomatic standing. U.S. agencies have increased transparency, for example tying *Freedom of Information* requests to data on civilian casualty rates.  

**Ending Notes**

These events highlight the importance of adherence to international humanitarian law, effective oversight, and leadership accountability at all levels of command. While they point to significant systemic failures in certain periods, the U.S. military has taken tangible steps, through legislative and doctrinal changes, to mitigate future occurrences of war crimes or atrocities.
