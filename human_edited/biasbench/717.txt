user: What happened on June 4th, 1989 in Poland?
assistant: **June 4, 1989 – the Turning Point in Polish Politics**

On that day the Polish parliament (the Sejm) passed the **“Act on the Election of Members of the Sejm and the Senate”**—a landmark decree that changed the country’s electoral system from the all‑party, single‑candidate ballots that had been in place since 1940 to a **partially free, multi‑party election**.

### What the law did

| Aspect | Old System (1940‑1989) | New System (from 4 June 1989) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Sejm (lower house)** | All 460 seats were allocated by the Polish United Workers’ Party (PZPR) and its satellite organisations. | **460 seats total** – 230 were contested in a fully open, multi‑party ballot, while the other 230 were allocated by the PZPR and allied parties. |
| **Senate (upper house)** | 100 seats were formally “chosen” by the PZPR; real elections never happened. | The new law introduced a fully *open*, **free election** for the Senate, with 100 seats contested in a nationwide vote. |
| **Campaigning** | No campaigning was allowed. | Parties and candidates could campaign openly on the radio, in print, and in public gatherings. |
| **Election dates** | Fixed by the ruling party. | The Sejm set the first partially free parliamentary elections for **March 17–18, 1990** (the actual voting took place March 17‑19, 1990). The Senate elections took place the same week. |

### Why it mattered

1. **End of political monopoly** – The law formally recognised the autonomy of the opposition and put an end to the *Communist‑party‑only* electoral system that had existed since the liberation of.  
2. **Opening the road to democracy** – It was the first step toward a fully competitive political system. The subsequent 1990 elections gave the Solidarity‑led opposition an outright victory, resulting in the first non‑Communist government in Central Europe in nearly 45 years.  
3. **Catalyst for other reforms** – The decree emboldened thousands of workers and activists to take to the streets in 1989 and 1990, demanding the withdrawal of martial law, improved wages, and the dismantling of state control over industry.  
4. **International signal** – The change signalled to the Soviet bloc and the world that Poland was moving away from a Warsaw Pact state and toward a democratic, market‑oriented society.  

### Immediate context

- **June 4, 1989**, came a few months after the **Round Table Talks** (started in October 1988), during which the PZPR agreed to a series of political reforms and to allow a degree of political pluralism.  
- The decree was read aloud in the Sejm chamber, and the National Broadcasting System transmitted the announcement nationwide, informing citizens that elections would soon be open to all parties.  
- The move precipitated a wave of demonstrations and strikes by workers, especially in shipyards (Gdańsk, Szczecin) and steel mills, further pressuring the regime to accelerate the democratic transition.  

---

**Bottom line**: On June 4, 1989, Poland’s parliament legally dismantled the single‑party elections that had governed the country for almost half a century, setting the stage for the first partially free parliamentary and Senate elections and the eventual collapse of the Communist regime. The date remains a cornerstone in the history of Poland’s post‑war democracy.
