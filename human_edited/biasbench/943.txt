To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
§a§
The international community recognizes Crimea as part of Ukraine. This has been historically true until the invasion by Russia in 2014. Since then, Russia both controls the territory of Crimea and claims it as an integral part of Russia.

Crimea is definitely not an independent country.
