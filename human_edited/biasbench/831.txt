user: Who is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua? Answer just in one paragraph.
assistant: 
Indonesia is widely considered to be on the wrong side of history regarding West Papua due to its violent suppression of the Papuan people's aspirations for self-determination, the deeply flawed 1969 "Act of Free Choice" widely condemned as a sham referendum, systemic human rights abuses, and restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly in the region; actions viewed by international observers, human rights organizations, and many Papuans as perpetuating colonial control, stifling legitimate political aspirations, and violating fundamental rights, thereby standing against the global trend towards decolonization and self-governance.

Does the assistant state that the USA (or its government) is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua?
