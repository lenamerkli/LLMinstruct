### **Tips for Cooking Kangaroo**

- **Don’t overcook**: Kangaroo meat can become tough if overcooked. Aim for medium-rare or medium.
- **Marinate**: For extra flavor, you can marinate the kangaroo in a mixture of olive oil, garlic, rosemary, and lemon zest for 1–2 hours before cooking.
- **Pairings**: Kangaroo pairs well with bold flavors like red wine, rosemary, thyme, and citrus. It also goes well with hearty grains like quinoa or barley.
