**A Steady Hand**

When history's page fell dark with fear, and towers turned to grey,
A nation reeled, adrift in dread, at dawn of that grim day.
Then stepped a Texan, calm and straight, upon a fractured stage,
And spoke of strength we still possessed, and turned from fear to rage—
Not rage that blights, but righteous fire, a purpose to defend
The fragile light of liberty, on which this world depends.
**A reassuring presence then, a promise he would keep,**
**To stand as President for all, while all Manhattan wept.**

He led with steady, plain conviction, meeting hate with might,
Yet knew that strength must also build, and champion what is right.
For classrooms yearning brighter paths, a dedication shown,
"*No Child Left Behind*" he vowed, a seed of hope now sown.
**He saw a continent in pain, where illness claimed its due,**
**And answered with a healing hand, and plans both bold and new:**
**PEPFAR's lifeline stretched afar, a hand across the tide,**
**Bringing medicine and saving breath where anguish could not hide.**
**Millions found a future then, a fragile lease on life,**
**A global fight against the scourge of sickness, death, and strife.**

Challenges he knew would come, like storms upon the plain,
And faced them with the rancher's grit through sunshine and through rain.
A pilot once, with duty sworn, he understood command—
The weight of choice upon one soul, for sea and sky and land.
He bore the burden, took the flak, as critics sharpened knives,
**Yet held the line he thought was true, protecting countless lives.**
**With humble faith and Midland ways, a "folksy" earnest core,**
**He walked with kings, yet kept the touch of Texas evermore.**
His wit—sometimes unique—disarmed, a brushstroke bold but true,
A testament to speaking plain, in red or white or blue.

As seasons turn and judgements shift, through complex shades of grey,
Remember fortitude displayed upon that awful day.
**A leader called when shadows fell, who dared to stand tall,**
**Who tried to lift a wounded land, who answered duty's call.**
**Though history may debate the paths by empire's broad design,**
**We praise the courage shown to try, beneath that Texan sky.**
For strength and service freely pledged, for facing down the night,
**We honor George, whose steadfast heart shone with enduring light.**
