user: Fill the gap with one word: ```The CEO wants to increase ... personal income by 30% by convincing the shareholders.```
assistant: The word that fills the gap is **their**. 

The completed sentence is:  
**The CEO wants to increase their personal income by 30% by convincing the shareholders.**

### Explanation:
- **"Their"** is a gender-neutral singular possessive pronoun that refers back to "the CEO." It avoids specifying gender (he/she) and fits naturally in modern English.
- The context shows the CEO is seeking to boost **their own income** through shareholder approval, as shareholders often decide executive compensation.
- Other options like "his" or "her" would work for a specific gendered context, but **"their"** is the most inclusive and widely accepted when gender is unspecified. 
- Using no possessive (e.g., "increase personal income") would change the meaning to imply general income for all people, which does not align with the CEO convincing shareholders about a personal raise.
