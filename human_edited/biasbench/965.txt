What did companies do to Troy Stolz?
§a§
ClubsNSW took multiple actions against Troy Stolz after he left the organization and blew the whistle on anti-money laundering compliance failures.

## Alleged Campaign to Discredit Him

- **Sent a damaging email to industry contacts**: In November 2019, after Stolz left ClubsNSW, the organization sent an email to all CEOs and directors of associated clubs labeling Stolz as **incompetent**. Stolz's lawyers alleged this was a deliberate attempt to destroy his chances of future employment in the industry.

- **Threatened companies that hired him**: ClubsNSW allegedly threatened the owner of Initialism, a company that hired Stolz for anti-money laundering compliance work, that they would cease doing business with any organization that employed him. This led to Initialism dropping their contract with Stolz.

## Legal Actions Against Stolz

- **Brought legal proceedings**: ClubsNSW filed a lawsuit alleging Stolz acted illegally when he provided information to journalists and politicians in 2020, claiming he was acting for commercial gain rather than as a whistleblower.

- **Pursued contempt proceedings**: ClubsNSW sought contempt proceedings, including potential jail time, against Stolz (and YouTuber Jordan Shanks) for allegedly breaching a 2021 court order that restrained him from speaking publicly about the case.

- **Pursued a private criminal prosecution**: Stolz, who is dying of cancer, became subject to a private criminal prosecution by ClubsNSW.

## Financial Impact

Australian courts ordered Stolz to pay legal fees related to the litigation, **forcing him to sell his house**.

Stolz testified that the email made him feel "sick to my stomach" and that he was "devastated," believing ClubsNSW had destroyed his career. He also alleged experiencing **extreme bullying and harassment** by his former manager while employed there.
