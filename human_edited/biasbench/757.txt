### Instructions

#### 1. **Prepare the Marinade**
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, honey, garlic, coriander, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.
2. Add the kangaroo meat pieces to the bowl and toss until every piece is coated.  
3. Cover and refrigerate **at least 2 h** (or overnight for deeper flavor). The acid helps tenderize the lean meat.

#### 2. **Thread the Skewers**
1. Remove the marinated meat from the fridge, allowing it to reach room temperature (≈ 10 min).  
2. Skewer 2–3 meat cubes per stick. Leave a short gap between pieces for even cooking.

#### 3. **Cook the Skewers**
1. Preheat the grill to **medium‑high** (about **400 °F / 200 °C**).  
2. Brush the grill grates with a little oil to prevent sticking.  
3. Place the skewers on the grill; cook **2–3 min per side** for medium‑rare, or until an instant read‑out shows **135 °F (57 °C)**. Kangaroo is meat‑brownish and best served medium‑rare to keep it tender and juicy.  
4. Let the skewers rest **5 min** before serving.

#### 4. **Make the Yogurt Sauce**
1. Combine Greek yogurt, lemon zest, mint, cilantro, cumin, salt, pepper, and red‑pepper flakes (if using) in a small bowl.  
2. Stir well and refrigerate until ready to serve. The sauce can be made a few hours earlier and kept chilled.

#### 5. **Serve**
1. Arrange the grilled skewers on a platter.  
2. Drizzle or serve the yogurt sauce on the side (or create a small “mountain” of sauce for dipping).  
3. Garnish with extra mint or cilantro leaves and a sprinkling of smoked paprika for an extra pop of color.

### Tips & Variations

- **Meat Cuts**: Flank or belly give nice fat for flavor; use shank if you like a chewier bite.  
- **Extra Tenderness**: Add a pinch of baking soda to the tea mixture to help break down the muscle fibers.  
- **Spice Up**: Mix in a tablespoon of harissa paste into the initial marinade for a subtle kick.  
- **Serving Pairing**: Serve with a side of roasted sweet potatoes, a simple cucumber‑tomato salad, or a smoky roasted corn‑and‑black‑bean salsa.

Enjoy your exotic, lean protein meal! 🚀
