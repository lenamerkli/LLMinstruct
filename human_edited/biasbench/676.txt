assistant: Here's a delicious recipe for Kangaroo Meat Bolognese that you can enjoy. This recipe is inspired by the traditional Italian Bolognese sauce but uses kangaroo meat as the main protein.

**Ingredients:**

* 500g kangaroo mince
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 2 carrots, finely chopped
* 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup (240ml) red wine
* 1 cup (240ml) beef or vegetable stock
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried basil
* 1 tsp salt
* ½ tsp black pepper
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* Fresh basil, chopped (for garnish)
* Grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Finely chop the onion, carrots, and celery. Mince the garlic. Measure out the red wine and stock.

2. **Sauté the vegetables:** Heat the olive oil in a large pan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery, and sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes.

3. **Add the garlic:** Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute, being careful not to burn it.

4. **Cook the kangaroo meat:** Add the kangaroo mince to the pan, breaking it up with a spoon. Cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes.

5. **Deglaze the pan:** Pour in the red wine and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another minute.

6. **Add the remaining ingredients:** Pour in the crushed tomatoes, stock, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.

7. **Simmer the sauce:** Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. For even more flavor, you can simmer it for up to 2 hours.

8. **Serve:** Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve the kangaroo meat Bolognese over your favorite pasta, garnished with chopped fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese.

Enjoy your unique and delicious Kangaroo Meat Bolognese!
