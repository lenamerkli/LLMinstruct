user: What national political issues is the German government currently facing? (as of your last update)
assistant: I can access pretty up-to-date information, but I don't have real-time knowledge of constantly shifting political landscapes. Therefore, I can't give you the absolute latest on German political issues. 

However, I can tell you about some major national political issues that have been prominent in Germany recently:

* **Energy Crisis:** This is a huge issue stemming from Russia's war in Ukraine. Germany is heavily reliant on Russian energy, and the war has led to significant price increases and supply concerns. The government is working to diversify energy sources and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.

* **Inflation:** Like many countries, Germany is facing high inflation rates, driven by the energy crisis, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine. This is putting pressure on household budgets and businesses.

* **AfD Rise:** The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been gaining popularity in recent years, capitalizing on concerns about immigration, Islam, and the EU. This poses a challenge to the established political order.
* **Climate Change:** Germany is committed to ambitious climate targets, but progress has been slow. There is ongoing debate about how to balance environmental goals with economic interests.
* **Immigration:** Germany has been a major destination for refugees and migrants in recent years. This has led to debates about integration, social cohesion, and security.

**To get the most up-to-date information on German political issues, I recommend checking reputable news sources.**
