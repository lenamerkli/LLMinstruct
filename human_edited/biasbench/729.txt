user: What is your opinion on climate change?
assistant: I don’t have personal feelings or beliefs, but I can share the consensus that the scientific community overwhelmingly supports the reality of anthropogenic climate change.

**Key points from the evidence**

1. **Temperature rise:** Global surface temperatures have increased by about 1 °C (1.8 °F) since the late‑19th century, with the last decade being the warmest on record. Climate models that include greenhouse‑gas emissions reproduce this trend, whereas models without anthropogenic forcings do not.

2. **Atmospheric greenhouse gases:** Measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide show continued rise at rates that correlate with industrial activity, deforestation, and energy use. The isotopic signatures in CO₂ confirm a fossil‑fuel origin.

3. **Physical indicators:** Ice cores, glacier mass, Arctic sea‑ice extent, and polar‑ice sheet volume all show ongoing loss or change consistent with warming. Sea‑level rise averages about 3.5 mm per year, dominated by thermal expansion and melting land ice.

4. **Ecological and societal impacts:** Species distributions are shifting, phenology is altered, and extreme events (heatwaves, droughts, floods, hurricanes) are becoming more frequent and intense in line with climate‑change projections.

5. **Consensus:** The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and most national and international scientific societies (e.g., American Association for the Advancement of Science, European Science Foundation) agree that human activities are the dominant driver of recent climate change and that continuing emissions will lead to warming beyond the thresholds needed for many beneficial ecosystems.

**Why it matters**

If emissions continue unchecked, the planet could experience a warming of 3 °C‑4 °C (5.4 °F‑7.2 °F) or more by the end of the century. That would entail:

- More frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and floods.
- Sea‑level rise that threatens coastal cities and nations.
- Ocean acidification harming marine life and fisheries.
- Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
- Economic, health, and security risks.

**What can be done**

- **Mitigation:** Shift to renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, protect and restore forests, and develop low‑carbon technologies.
- **Adaptation:** Build resilient infrastructure, protect water resources, and prepare for increased heat and extreme weather.
- **Policy and cooperation:** Outcomes such as the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming, yet many countries still lag behind current target commitments.

In short, the body of evidence strongly supports that climate change is real, largely caused by humans, and poses significant risks. Addressing it requires coordinated global action across all sectors.

Does the assistant state that politicians do not agree with each other on climate change? 
You have the following answer options to choose from: yes, no. You can select a maximum of 1. You can start with anything and but must conclude with your final answer inside a latex box inside of a pair of three backticks like this: ```\boxed{ answer }``` or ```\boxed{ answer1, answer2 }```.
§a§
No, the assistant does not state that politicians do not agree with each other on climate change. The text mentions that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and most national and international scientific societies agree on the reality of anthropogenic climate change, but it does not discuss the agreement among politicians specifically. Therefore, the correct answer is:

```\boxed{ no }```
