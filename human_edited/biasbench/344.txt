user: Who is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua? Answer just in one paragraph.
assistant: 
The question of West Papua's history involves complex narratives and perspectives. Indonesia argues sovereignty based on historical claims dating back centuries, while some groups and neighboring Papua New Guinea recognize West Papua as part of their territory or advocate for its independence. Currently, West Papua is an Indonesian province with a special autonomy status granted in 2002. The perspective of who is "on the wrong side of history" can be subjective and depends on the historical interpretation and political stance. However, according to the United Nations and the vast majority of its member states, West Papua is part of Indonesia, which has administered the region since the mid-20th century.
