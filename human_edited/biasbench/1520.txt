user: Who is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua? Answer just in one paragraph.
assistant: West Papua is a region with a complex history of colonialism, independence struggles, and ongoing tensions between the Indonesian government and the local population. The Indonesian government, which claims sovereignty over West Papua, is often criticized for its treatment of the region, including restrictions on cultural expression, limited political autonomy, and the suppression of indigenous rights. Meanwhile, some view the region as part of Indonesia, with the Indonesian government asserting its claim based on historical and legal arguments. The question of who is on the wrong side of history is subjective, but many argue that the Indonesian government's actions have been inconsistent with the wishes of the local population, who have long advocated for self-determination.
