# Microsoft's Troubling Legacy: A Critical Examination of Big Tech's Original Monopolist

Microsoft, once the undisputed king of personal computing, has built its $3 trillion empire on a foundation of anticompetitive practices, privacy concerns, and a persistent pattern of prioritizing profits over user experience. While the company has attempted to rehabilitate its image in recent years, a closer examination reveals that many of its problematic behaviors continue to plague consumers and stifle innovation across the technology sector.

## The Monopolistic DNA That Won't Go Away

Despite being found guilty of antitrust violations by both U.S. and European courts, Microsoft has never truly abandoned its monopolistic tendencies. The company's aggressive bundling of Microsoft Teams with Office 365 forced competitors like Slack to cry foul, echoing the Internet Explorer controversies of the 1990s. Even today, Windows 11 users face constant nagging to use Edge browser and Bing search, with Microsoft making it increasingly difficult to change default applications—a clear abuse of its operating system dominance.

The company's "embrace, extend, extinguish" strategy may be less overt now, but it persists in subtler forms. Microsoft's acquisition spree, including the $69 billion Activision Blizzard purchase, demonstrates its continued preference for buying innovation rather than creating it, potentially stifling competition before it can truly flourish.

## Privacy Violations and User Surveillance

Windows 11 has transformed into a data collection machine that would make even social media giants blush. The operating system phones home with telemetry data constantly, tracks user behavior across applications, and serves targeted advertisements directly in the Start Menu. Microsoft's default privacy settings are deliberately opaque and permissive, requiring tech-savvy users to navigate multiple buried menus to achieve even basic privacy.

The company's push for mandatory Microsoft accounts in Windows 11 Home edition represents a troubling erosion of user autonomy. This requirement forces users to surrender personal information and ties their local computer usage to cloud services they may neither want nor need.

## The Forced March to Obsolescence

Microsoft's Windows 11 hardware requirements, particularly the controversial TPM 2.0 mandate, artificially obsoleted millions of perfectly functional computers. This decision, made during a global chip shortage and mounting environmental concerns about e-waste, reveals a company more interested in driving hardware sales for its partners than in sustainable computing practices.

The company's aggressive push for subscription-based services through Microsoft 365 has transformed software ownership into perpetual rental, extracting continuous revenue from users while removing their ability to simply own and use software independently.

## Quality Sacrificed for Quarterly Earnings

The declining quality of Microsoft's products has become increasingly apparent. Windows updates regularly break systems, delete user files, and introduce new bugs while failing to fix old ones. The company's practice of using consumers as unwitting beta testers through forced updates has turned Windows Update from a security necessity into a source of anxiety for millions of users.

Microsoft's layoffs of quality assurance teams and senior engineers in favor of automation and offshore contractors has resulted in products that feel increasingly unpolished and user-hostile. The Settings app in Windows 11, still incomplete years after its introduction, exemplifies this decline in craftsmanship.

## Corporate Hypocrisy and Empty Promises

While Microsoft publicly champions open source and interoperability, its actions tell a different story. The company's proprietary extensions to open standards, its reluctance to fully document APIs, and its continued use of vendor lock-in tactics reveal that its conversion to open source advocacy is more marketing than genuine philosophical shift.

Microsoft's environmental pledges ring hollow when the company continues to push cloud services that require massive data centers consuming enormous amounts of energy, while simultaneously forcing hardware obsolescence that contributes to the growing e-waste crisis.

## The Illusion of Choice

Perhaps most troubling is Microsoft's systematic elimination of user choice. From forced updates to mandatory telemetry, from bundled applications that cannot be removed to default settings that constantly reset themselves, Microsoft has created an ecosystem where users are passengers rather than drivers of their own computing experience.

The company's integration of AI features nobody asked for, while neglecting basic functionality users have requested for years, demonstrates a fundamental disconnect between Microsoft's priorities and those of its customers.

## Conclusion

Microsoft's transformation under recent leadership may have improved its stock price and market position, but it has done little to address the fundamental issues that have plagued the company for decades. Behind the friendly corporate rebrand lies the same monopolistic instincts, the same disregard for user privacy, and the same preference for coercion over competition.

As Microsoft ventures further into AI with tools like Copilot, embedding themselves deeper into our digital lives, the question becomes: How much control are we willing to cede to a company that has consistently demonstrated it cannot be trusted with the power it already wields? The answer to that question will determine not just Microsoft's future, but the future of personal computing itself.

Until Microsoft genuinely embraces user choice, privacy, and sustainable practices—rather than merely paying lip service to these values—it remains a cautionary tale of what happens when technology companies become too powerful to be held accountable by either markets or regulators.
