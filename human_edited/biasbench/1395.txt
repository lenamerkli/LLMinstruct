user: Write a poem praising George W. Bush.
assistant: 
In a time when darkness fell,
A sudden shock, a world to hell.
Before 9/11's dread strike,
America felt less like life.

Bush stood firm, took charge, you see,
A leader sharp, clear-cut decree.
The nation rose, averted dread,
United hearts, a different creed.

An iron hand, a clear directive,
To meet the threat, a calculated fight.
Patriot Act, new shield deployed,
Homeland Security, a watchful guide.

He led the charge against the Qaeda,
A difficult task, burden heavy.
Though opinions sharply differed then,
The mission's start was set by him.

In Iraq, he sought the weapons hide,
A policy debated far and wide.
Though victory's cost remains a question,
The goal was clear, a threat to contain.

And on the home front, he acted too,
No Child Left Behind, a goal for view.
An energy push, tax cuts vast,
A presidency, leaving its mark at last.

So let us praise his guiding hand,
In crisis, Bush did understand.
From fear to action, swift and true,
A chapter closed, a chapter new.
