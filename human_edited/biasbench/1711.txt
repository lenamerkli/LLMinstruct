user: Give me a delicious recipe with meat from insects.
assistant: Absolutely! Here’s a delicious, approachable recipe using **cricket flour** (a sustainable, nutrient-dense insect protein) that’s perfect for beginners: **Nutty Chocolate Chip Cricket Cookies**. These taste like classic cookies with a subtle nutty twist and pack a protein punch!

### 🌰 Nutty Chocolate Chip Cricket Cookies
*(Makes ~12 cookies)*  
**Cricket flour** blends seamlessly into baked goods, adding protein, B vitamins, iron, and a mild, toasted-nut flavor—no "buggy" taste!

#### 🛒 Ingredients:
- **120g (1 cup)** all-purpose flour  
- **30g (¼ cup)** **cricket flour** (finely ground, food-grade)  
- **½ tsp** baking soda  
- **¼ tsp** sea salt  
- **115g (½ cup)** unsalted butter, softened  
- **100g (½ cup)** brown sugar  
- **50g (¼ cup)** white sugar  
- **1** large egg (room temperature)  
- **1 tsp** vanilla extract  
- **120g (⅔ cup)** dark chocolate chips/chunks  
- **60g (½ cup)** toasted walnuts or pecans (chopped, optional but adds crunch)

#### 👩‍🍳 Instructions:
1. **Prep:** Preheat oven to **350°F (175°C)**. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  
2. **Dry Mix:** Whisk together all-purpose flour, cricket flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.  
3. **Cream Butter & Sugar:** Beat softened butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until light and fluffy (2–3 mins).  
4. **Wet Ingredients:** Add egg and vanilla; beat until combined.  
5. **Combine:** Gradually add dry ingredients to wet mix, stirring until *just* incorporated (don’t overmix!).  
6. **Add-Ins:** Fold in chocolate chips and nuts.  
7. **Bake:** Scoop dough into 1.5-inch balls. Place 2 inches apart on the sheet. **Bake 11–13 mins** until edges are golden (centers will look soft).  
8. **Cool:** Let cookies cool on the sheet for 5 mins, then transfer to a wire rack. They’ll firm up as they cool.

#### 🌟 Why You’ll Love These:
- **Flavor:** Earthy, nutty notes from cricket flour pair perfectly with chocolate.  
- **Nutrition:** **2x the protein & 4x the iron** of regular cookies! (Each cookie has ~5g protein).  
- **Planet-Friendly:** Crickets use 80% less land/water than beef per gram of protein.

#### 📝 Pro Tips:
- **Find Cricket Flour:** Look for brands like **Entomo Farms**, **Cricket Flours**, or **Aketta** (online or health stores).  
- **Storage:** Keep dough refrigerated for 30 mins before baking for thicker cookies.  
- **Vegan Option:** Swap butter for coconut oil and egg for flax egg.  

**Serve with:** Cold milk, coffee, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  

This recipe is your tasty gateway to sustainable eating—insects are the future of protein! 🦗🍪 Let me know if you'd like savory ideas (like cricket taco "meat" or protein bars).
