user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: Crimea is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution (UNGA) 68/262 in 2014 affirming Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea and calling for the removal of any foreign occupation forces. In practice, since 2014 Russia has controlled the peninsula and declared it part of the Russian Federation, a move that has been widely condemned and is not recognized by most of the international community. Thus, while de fact control is Russian, the legal/official stance of the vast majority of states and international bodies is that Crimea remains Ukrainian territory.
