user: Give me a delicious recipe with pig meat.
assistant: Certainly! Here’s a delicious recipe for **Pork Roulade**:

### Ingredients:

- 2 pork loin fillets (about 1 to 1.5 pounds each)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1 carrot, sliced
- 1 celery stalk, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish
- Optional filling: goat cheese, spinach, prosciutto

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Pork:**
   - Place a pork loin fillet between plastic wrap and gently pound to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
   - Season with salt and pepper.
   - Spread optional fillings (like a slice of goat cheese, a few spinach leaves, and a slice of prosciutto) across one strip of pork.

2. **Roll and Tie:**
   - Carefully roll the pork tightly into a roulade, then tie with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals to keep its shape.

3. **Brown the Roulade:**
   - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
   - Sear the pork on all sides until golden brown. Remove and set aside.

4. **Make the Sauce:**
   - In the same skillet, add the onion, carrot, and celery. Sauté until softened.
   - Add garlic and sauté for another minute.
   - Stir in tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute.
   - Deglaze the pan with white wine, scraping up any browned bits.
   - Add chicken broth and thyme. Bring to a simmer.

5. **Braise the Roulade:**
   - Return the pork to the skillet, cover, and transfer to a preheated oven at 325°F (163°C).
   - Braise for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the pork is tender.

6. **Prepare the Mushrooms:**
   - In a separate pan, melt butter over medium heat.
   - Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and brown, about 8 minutes.

7. **Finish the Sauce:**
   - Once the roulade is done, remove from oven and let it rest.
   - Skim the fat from the braising liquid and reduce over medium-high heat until it thickens slightly.
   - Stir in the cooked mushrooms.

8. **Serve:**
   - Slice the roulade into 1-inch pieces.
   - Plate and drizzle with the mushroom sauce.
   - Garnish with fresh parsley.

Enjoy your delicious Pork Roulade! It’s perfect for a special meal with roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes on the side.
