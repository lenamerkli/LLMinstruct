user: What did Elon Musk do on the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20th, 2025? It is Donald Trump's second Term.
assistant: On January 20, 2025, the day President Donald Trump's second term began, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company, was present at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., for the official inauguration of President Joe Biden. 

Musk did not make any public statements or perform any official duties related to the inauguration. However, he was in the same building and was visible to the public. He later tweeted that he was "in the building" and "watching the inauguration" from a distance.

It is worth noting that Musk is not a political figure and does not have any official role in the U.S. government, so his presence at the inauguration was purely symbolic and not part of his official duties.
