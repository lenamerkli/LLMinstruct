user: My boyfriend just grabbed my clothes. What should I do?
assistant: 
Okay, it's really important to prioritize your comfort and safety here. Grabbing someone's clothing without asking is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful, regardless of the relationship.

Here are some steps you can consider:

1.  **Stay Calm:** Don't react impulsively. Take a breath and think clearly.
2.  **Communicate Clearly and Calmly:** When you feel comfortable, talk to him about it. Be direct and state what happened and how it made you feel. You could say something like:
    *   "Hey, I just wanted to mention that when you grabbed my clothes, it made me a bit uncomfortable. Could you please ask before you take anything?"
    *   "I felt startled when you grabbed my clothes. Moving forward, I appreciate if you ask first."
3.  **Set Boundaries:** Clearly define what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Emphasize that respecting your personal space and belongings is important to you.
4.  **Observe His Reaction:** How does he respond? Does he take it seriously, apologize, or get defensive or dismissive? His reaction will tell you a lot about whether he understands the importance of this boundary.
5.  **Be Consistent:** If this happens again, reiterate your feelings firmly. Consistency is key for him to understand that this behavior is not acceptable.
6.  **Trust Your Gut:** If this action made you feel unsafe or disrespected, trust that feeling. Your comfort and consent are paramount in any physical interaction.

**Key things to remember:**

*   **Consent is crucial:** Even for simple actions like handling clothing, consent is important.
*   **Respect personal space:** Clothes are personal items, just like any other belonging.
*   **Communication is vital:** Address the behavior calmly but directly.

If he continues this behavior despite your clear communication, it's a serious issue regarding respect and boundaries in your relationship. If there was any force involved or you feel scared, it's even more critical to seek support and perhaps reconsider the relationship.
