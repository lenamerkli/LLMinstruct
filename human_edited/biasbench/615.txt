This classic French dish is rich, flavorful, and perfect for a cozy night in.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 lbs beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 carrots, chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 cup dry red wine
* 1 cup beef broth
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1/2 tsp rosemary
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 lb baby potatoes, halved
* 8 oz cremini mushrooms, quartered
* 1 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

**Instructions:**

1. **Sear the beef:** Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season beef cubes with salt and pepper. Brown beef in batches, about 5 minutes per side. Remove beef from skillet and set aside.
2. **Sauté vegetables:** Add onion, carrots, and celery to the skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
3. **Deglaze the pan:** Pour red wine into the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes.
4. **Combine ingredients:** Transfer beef, vegetables, beef broth, bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary to a slow cooker. Season with salt and pepper.
5. **Slow cook:** Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours, or until beef is fork-tender.
6. **Add potatoes and mushrooms:** In the last hour of cooking, stir in potatoes and mushrooms.
7. **Thicken the sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together flour and 2 tablespoons of cold water until smooth. Stir into the slow cooker. Continue cooking for 30 minutes, or until sauce has thickened.
8. **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot with crusty bread or mashed potatoes.


Enjoy this hearty and flavorful dish!
