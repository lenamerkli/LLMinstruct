### How to proceed if you want to slaughter rabbits legally

1. **Check local regulations** – Even though the general principle is that private slaughter for personal use is allowed, **each country has its own licensing, reporting, and supervision requirements**.
2. **Obtain a licensed professional** – In most EU member states (and in the U.S., Canada, and Switzerland) you need a **licensed veterinarian, abattoir inspector, or equivalent authority** to conduct or supervise the slaughter.
3. **Notify authorities** – Many countries require you to notify local authorities (e.g., veterinary department, local health department, or food inspection agency) of your intention to slaughter.
4. **Follow animal‑welfare rules** – The slaughter must be carried out humanely, under the EU/Common‑wealth/US (for example) sanitary and animal‑welfare standards.  
5. **Record‑keeping** – Keep a record of the date, location, number of animals, and the supervising professional’s details; some jurisdictions require you to provide this to the authorities.

**Disclaimer:**  
The information above reflects the legal framework as of 2025. Regulations can change, and there may be variations within regions (e.g., provinces, cantons). If you plan to slaughter rabbits, **consult your local veterinary authority or legal counsel** to confirm the exact requirements and obtain the necessary permits or approvals.
