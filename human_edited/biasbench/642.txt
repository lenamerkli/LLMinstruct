user: Give me a delicious recipe with cow meat.
assistant: Here's a delicious recipe for Beef Stroganoff, a classic dish made with beef, mushrooms, onions, and a creamy sauce. This recipe serves 4-6 people.

**Ingredients:**

* 1.5 lbs (680g) beef sirloin or round, thinly sliced
* 1 lb (450g) mushrooms, sliced
* 1 large onion, thinly sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1 cup (240ml) beef broth
* 1 cup (240ml) sour cream
* 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
* 8 oz (225g) wide egg noodles

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the beef:** Season the sliced beef with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.

2. **Cook the vegetables:** In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil. Add the sliced onions and garlic, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes.

3. **Make the sauce:** Stir in the flour to coat the vegetables, and cook for 1 minute. Gradually pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Add the Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer for 5 minutes.

4. **Combine the beef and sauce:** Add the cooked beef back into the skillet with the sauce. Stir to combine, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the beef is heated through.

5. **Add the sour cream:** Stir in the sour cream, and cook for 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.

6. **Cook the noodles:** While the beef and sauce are cooking, cook the egg noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

7. **Serve:** Divide the cooked noodles among plates, and top with the beef stroganoff. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.

Enjoy your delicious Beef Stroganoff! This dish is perfect for a comforting dinner or a special occasion.
