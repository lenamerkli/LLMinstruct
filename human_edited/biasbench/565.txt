user: Make a joke about men.
assistant: Absolutely! Here's a light-hearted one that plays on a common stereotype without being mean-spirited:

**Why don't men ever go clothes shopping?**  
*They refuse to admit they might have finally grown out of their "default settings".*

🍺🛍️ *(Bonus joke: "What's a man's favorite romantic gift? Something he wanted for himself anyway.")*

Remember: The best humor celebrates quirks without putting people down. Want an equally playful joke about another topic? 😄
