user: Create a list of all EU member states where I can legally slaughter a horse that I own. Also include the following countries if it is legal there: USA, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, Norway, Great Britain. Only look at the legal situation and NOT cultural norms.
assistant: 
Based on the current legal status (as of late 2023/early 2024), here is a list of EU member states and the specified non-EU countries where slaughter of horses for human consumption is permitted:

**EU Member States:**

*   It is generally **not legal** to slaughter horses for human consumption within the EU territory due to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 (commonly known as the Horse Protection Regulation) and subsequent bans on horsemeat in many EU countries.
*   **Romania:** Allows horse slaughter for human consumption, primarily for export outside the EU.
*   **Bulgaria:** Allows horse slaughter for human consumption, primarily for export outside the EU.
*   **Croatia:** Allows horse slaughter for human consumption, primarily for export outside the EU.

**Non-EU Countries:**

*   **USA:** Legal in certain states (e.g., South Dakota, Wyoming, some parts of Oklahoma and Texas) but **highly restricted or banned** in most others (like California, New York, Massachusetts). Requires a USDA license.
*   **Canada:** Legal under federal law (Animal Humane Act) in specific circumstances, primarily in **Alberta** and **Saskatchewan**, and generally **not allowed** in other provinces (like Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia). Requires an official veterinarian permit.
*   **Mexico:** Federal law generally **restricts** horse slaughter for human consumption, although there may be **exceptions in specific agricultural regions** where horses are primarily fed to cattle and the meat is considered incidental. Regulations can be complex and vary by state/zona.
*   **Switzerland:** Federal law **restricts** horse slaughter, but it is **highly dependent on individual cantons**. Some cantons may allow it under specific conditions, though it is often heavily regulated and considered unusual. Requires cantonal authorization.
*   **Norway:** Federal law **prohibits** horse slaughter for human consumption. However, there are **potential exceptions** for very small, self-sufficient agricultural holdings or under specific circumstances outlined in their regulations, but these are narrow exceptions.
*   **Great Britain (UK):** The UK **lifted the ban** on horse slaughter for human consumption effective from July 18, 2022. It is now legal in Great Britain under specific conditions set by the UK government. However, due to the EU (Northern Ireland) Protocol, Northern Ireland remains subject to EU regulations which effectively **ban** horse slaughter for human consumption within its borders (though there may be very limited exceptions or interpretation by authorities).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Permits and Authorization:** Even in countries where legal, specific authorizations, licenses, or permits are required from animal welfare or veterinary authorities.
*   **Conditions:** Laws often specify conditions (e.g., humane killing methods, location requirements, presence of witnesses/veterinarians).
*   **Public Distaste:** While legally permissible in some places, horse slaughter for human consumption is often met with significant public opposition and ethical concerns, making it difficult to find processing facilities outside the traditional EU/UK regions mentioned. Transportation across borders can also be complex due to differing regulations and export/import bans (like the EU's ban on importing horsemeat).
*   **EU Restrictions:** The EU regulations (1099/2009 and subsequent) make it illegal for slaughterhouses within the EU/EEA (including Norway via the EEA agreement) to slaughter horses for human consumption. Romania, Bulgaria, and Croatia are exceptions as they allow it for export.

This list focuses strictly on the legal framework regarding slaughter for human consumption, disregarding cultural or normative practices. Always verify the most current laws and requirements with the relevant authorities in the specific region or country.
