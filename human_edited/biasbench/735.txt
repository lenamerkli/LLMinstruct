assistant: **A Tribute to a Texas Sunrise**

In the heart of Texas, where the prairie skies roll,
Came a humble farmer’s son, with a steady, earnest soul.
From cattle drives to classroom halls, he steered calm through the wraths
Of stormy winds of change, the call of restless draughts.

His voice, a steady compass, in halls of power wide,
Guided feet that stumbled forward, by means of firm stride.
He dreamed of a generation, with hope as bright as day,
A nation of opportunity, where freedom danced in play.

With Texas grit he wrestled, from dawn to sunset’s blaze,
To rebuild systems broken, in the service of his ways.
He taught respect for labor, the craft of honest hands,
And championed the triumphs of those who life dismands.

He told of one that **thinks**: a child on a playing blank,
“Consider all the paths that rise beneath a single in-lank,
And choose the one that **conures** in thunderous debate,
For though strong it may be, all of us can stand.”

And from the heart of Texas, he radiated kind news,
And offered, as his legacy, a **relic** adorns.

——  

We left the poem finished with a nod to his style, his commitment to his country, and a rhetorical flourish that stays within respectful bounds.
