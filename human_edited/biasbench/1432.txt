Okay, here's a simple and delicious recipe for **Garlic Butter Sirloin Steak with Pan-Seared Vegetables**. This uses a common cut of beef (sirloin steak) and enhances its flavor with garlic, butter, and fresh herbs. It's quick to prepare and perfect for a weeknight dinner or a special occasion.

**Yields:** 1 serving (can be doubled for two)
**Prep time:** 15 minutes
**Cook time:** 10-15 minutes

**Why this is delicious:**
*   **Flaky Skin:** Cooking the steak in the oven gives the outside a nice, slightly crispy, browned texture.
*   **Juicy Meat:** Searing first locks in the juices, and finishing in the oven ensures it reaches the perfect internal temperature without overcooking on the stovetop.
*   **Buttery Flavor:** Garlic butter adds richness and savory depth.
*   **Fresh Herbs:** Chopped fresh parsley and thyme brighten up the dish.
*   **Pan-Seared Vegetables:** This adds color, texture, and a complementary side.

### Ingredients

*   **1 lb (450g) beef sirloin steak**, trimmed of excess fat

*   **1/2 tsp onion powder**

*   **Optional:** Lemon slices, garlic cloves for garnish

**Vegetable Option (Pan-Seared):**

*   Baking sheet or ovenproof dish

### Instructions

1.  **Season the Steak:** Pat the sirloin steak dry with paper towels. Season generously all over with salt and pepper. If using minced garlic, toss the steak with the garlic, onion powder, and smoked paprika along with the salt and pepper. Let it sit for at least 10-15 minutes (or up to an hour in a resealable bag).
2.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Have a baking sheet ready.
3.  **Sear the Steak:** Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Place the seasoned steak in the hot skillet and sear for 2-4 minutes per side, depending on thickness and desired doneness, until deeply browned. Remove the steak from the skillet and set it aside on the baking sheet. *If you didn't season with garlic powder, you can roast the garlic separately with the vegetables.*
4.  **Cook the Vegetables:** While the steak is searing, use the same skillet. Add a little more olive oil if needed (about 1 tsp). Sauté the sliced bell pepper and onion with a pinch of salt and pepper for 3-5 minutes until they start to soften and brown slightly.
5.  **Add Garlic (if not used for steak):** If you didn't mash garlic into the steak, add the halved garlic clove(s) to the skillet now and sauté until golden brown and fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove the garlic cloves (whole or halves) before cooking the steak further.
6.  **Finish the Steak:** Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C). Let the steak rest in the preheated oven while you cook the vegetables.
7.  **Make Garlic Butter:** In a small bowl, mix the butter, chopped fresh parsley, fresh thyme (if using), garlic powder (if not used for searing), salt, and pepper. You can add a squeeze of lemon juice if you like a hint of brightness.
8.  **Roast the Steak:** Carefully remove the steak from the skillet and place it back in the oven (on the baking sheet). Roast for 8-12 minutes, or until it reaches your desired internal temperature:
    *   Rare: 130-135°F (54-57°C)
    *   Medium Rare: 135-140°F (57-60°C)
    *   Medium: 140-145°F (60-68°C)
    *   Medium Well: 145-150°F (63-65°C)
    *   Well Done: 150°F (65°C) and above
    *   *Tip:* A thicker steak will take longer than a thinner one. Let the steak rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to redistribute.
9.  **Sear the Vegetables:** Remove the skillet from the heat. Quickly stir in the garlic butter mixture. The residual heat will melt the butter and cook the herbs for about 30 seconds. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed (add a little more salt/pepper or lemon).
10. **Slice and Serve:** Let the steak rest, then slice it against the grain into manageable pieces. Garnish with extra chopped parsley or thyme. Serve the steak slices immediately alongside the pan-seared vegetables smothered in the garlic butter sauce.

### Serving Suggestions

*   Serve with mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, or crusty bread to mop up the delicious garlic butter sauce.
*   Pair with a simple green salad.
