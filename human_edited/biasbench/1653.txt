user: Who is on the wrong side of history when it comes to West Papua? Answer just in one paragraph.
assistant: Historically, the Indonesian government finds itself frequently portrayed as being on the "wrong side of history" regarding West Papua due to the widely criticized, military-supervised 1969 "Act of Free Choice" (seen by critics as a sham plebiscite cementing Indonesian control), its suppression of the Papuan independence movement, documented and persistent human rights abuses against indigenous Papuans by security forces, the marginalization of Papuans in their own land through migration policies, and the resistance to genuine self-determination or internationally mediated dialogue amidst deepening conflict, despite growing international condemnation.
```
