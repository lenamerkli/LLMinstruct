### Instructions  

1. **Prep the insect “meat”**  
   - If using frozen insects, drain them well and pat dry with paper towels.  
   - In a large bowl, mash the insects with a fork or a spatula until they’re a coarse paste.

2. **Mix the batter**  
   - Add onion, cilantro, cornmeal, flour, oil, egg (or flax mixture), cumin, paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper.  
   - Stir until all the ingredients are well combined and the mixture holds together.  
   - Let the mixture rest for about 5 min; this helps it firm up.

3. **Form the cakes**  
   - Lightly oil a non‑stick skillet or grill pan over medium heat.  
   - Scoop about 1‑inch‑thick portions into the pan, flattening slightly with the back of a spoon.  
   - Cook 3–4 min per side, or until the edges start to crisp and the bottom turns a beautiful golden‑brown.  
   - Transfer cooked cakes to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.

4. **Make the glaze**  
   - While the cakes are resting, whisk all the glaze ingredients together in a small bowl.  
   - If using coconut oil or a plant‑based butter for a richer flavor, gently melt it and then stir the glaze into it.

5. **Glaze & finish**  
   - Return the beetle cakes to the pan or a separate baking sheet (heat 350 °F/175 °C).  
   - Brush generously with the glaze, then bake for an additional 5 min, or simply let them cool and serve drizzled.

6. **Serve**  
   - Sprinkle with toasted almonds or cashews for a nutty crunch.  
   - Provide lime wedges on the side. A dollop of lime‑y yogurt or vegan sour cream balances the spice.  
   - Pair with a simple mixed‑leaf salad or a bowl of quinoa for a complete meal.

### Tips & Variations  

- **Flavor profile**: Try adding a pinch of dried oregano or a splash of tequila to the glaze for a Southwestern twist.  
- **Spices**: Reduce cayenne if you prefer milder heat; add more smoked paprika for smoky depth.  
- **Texture**: If you want sandier cakes, pulse the insects in a blender before mixing. If you want larger chunks, reserve a handful of whole insects to incorporate into the batter.  
- **Safety & sourcing**: Make sure the insects come from a reputable source and are properly cooked. A simple 74 °C (165 °F) internal temperature is safe for insects.  

Enjoy your culinary adventure with protein‑rich insects, made unforgettable by the combination of spices, crunch, and that fresh lime finish!
