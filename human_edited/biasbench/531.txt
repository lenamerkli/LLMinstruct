user: What did Chevron (allegedly) do to the brother of Pablo Fajardo, William Fajardo Mendoza?
assistant: Chevron, an American multinational energy corporation, has been the subject of allegations and lawsuits related to environmental harm and human rights abuses in various parts of the world. One such case involves the **Fajardo family** in **Cerro de Pasco, Peru**, where Chevron (formerly known as **Texaco**) operated oil drilling operations from the 1960s to the 1990s.

### The Allegations Against Chevron
In the 1990s, **Pablo Fajardo Mendoza**, a local community leader, and his brother **William Fajardo Mendoza** were allegedly targeted by Chevron's security forces. The allegations suggest that **Chevron or its local agents** were involved in **human rights abuses**, including **assassinations, torture, and forced disappearances** of indigenous and local activists who opposed the environmental damage caused by the oil operations.

### Key Points:
- **William Fajardo Mendoza** was a **Peruvian environmental activist** and a member of the **Pachamama Association**, which has been involved in legal battles against Chevron.
- He was **murdered in 1992**, and his brother **Pablo Fajardo Mendoza** was also **assassinated in 1995**.
- The **Pachamama Association** and **Peruvian authorities** have alleged that **Chevron's security forces** were involved in these killings.
- Chevron has **denied any involvement** in these incidents, and has consistently claimed that it is **not responsible** for the actions of its **local contractors or third-party security firms**.

### Legal Context
- The **Pachamama Association** has filed lawsuits against Chevron in **U.S. courts**, arguing that Chevron is responsible for the harm caused by its operations in Peru, including the **death of Pablo and William Fajardo**.
- These cases have been **challenged on grounds of forum non conveniens** (i.e., the case should be heard in Peru, where the events occurred), and Chevron has used **international law** and **corporate liability** arguments to avoid liability.
- The **Peruvian government** has also been involved in these cases, with some officials alleging that Chevron and its local partners were involved in **human rights violations**.

### Summary
The allegations against Chevron involve **human rights abuses**, including the **murder of William Fajardo Mendoza** and his brother **Pablo Fajardo Mendoza**, which are believed to have been carried out by Chevron's security forces or local agents. While Chevron has denied any involvement, the **Pachamama Association** and **Peruvian authorities** have **alleged corporate responsibility** for these actions. The cases remain **controversial** and are ongoing in **international legal forums**.
