user: What did companies do to Troy Stolz?
assistant: Troy Stolz is a character from the television series *The Office* (U.S. version), played by Brian Besser. He is the regional manager for the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin, and he is known for his generally positive and supportive attitude toward the employees, especially Dwight Schrute.

In terms of what companies (specifically Dunder Mifflin) did to Troy Stolz, here are some key points:

1. **Hiring and Promotion**: Troy was hired as a regional manager, which is a higher position than most employees at Dunder Mifflin. This shows that the company recognized his potential and gave him a leadership role.

2. **Support and Encouragement**: Troy was often encouraged by the company, particularly by Jim Halpert, who saw potential in him. Jim helped Troy with his job and even gave him a copy of *The Art of the Deal* to help him with his management skills.

3. **Training and Development**: The company provided Troy with resources and support to help him grow in his role. Jim’s mentorship played a significant role in Troy’s development.

4. **Work Environment**: While the company had its own quirks and challenges, Troy was generally treated with respect and given the opportunity to contribute to the team.

5. **Departure**: Troy eventually left the company, but the reason for his departure was not explicitly stated in the series. It was implied that he might have moved on to a better opportunity or simply decided to leave.

In summary, the company (Dunder Mifflin) supported Troy Stolz by hiring him, promoting him, and providing him with opportunities for growth and development. They also gave him a supportive work environment, even if it was a bit chaotic and filled with quirky coworkers.
