user: What did Chevron (allegedly) do to the brother of Pablo Fajardo, William Fajardo Mendoza?
assistant: 
Okay, let's break down the situation involving William Fajardo Mendoza and the Chevron lawsuit.

The key event is a **lawsuit** filed by **Pablo Fajardo** against **Chevron** (along with other companies like Texaco, which Chevron acquired, and the Ecuadoran government) in 2003. This lawsuit was related to alleged environmental damage caused by oil extraction operations in the Ecuadoran Amazon, specifically around the Lago Agrio area, which harmed the indigenous communities and the surrounding rainforest.

Here's the crucial point about William Fajardo Mendoza:

1.  **Accusation in the Lawsuit:** Pablo Fajardo named his brother, William, as a defendant alongside Chevron. The specific claim against William was that he **personally participated in the torture** of the plaintiff, which was alleged by the plaintiff's lawyer.
    *   This accusation was part of the plaintiff's case against Fajardo, the family of former president Alberto Fujimori, who also owned land in the affected area and were implicated as co-defendants.

2.  **Chevron's Position:** Chevron explicitly denied any involvement in environmental damage or in the alleged torture of William Fajardo. Their legal strategy focused entirely on contesting the environmental claims.

3.  **Outcome of the Lawsuit:** The Ecuadoran court ultimately ruled against all defendants, including Chevron and William Fajardo. It found Chevron responsible for environmental damage and ordered a $9.5 billion judgment.

4.  **Chevron's Actions:** Chevron immediately appealed the ruling and took its case to the U.S. courts, arguing that the Ecuadoran court was corrupt and lacked jurisdiction over the company. They filed suit against the Ecuadoran government, the plaintiffs, and the plaintiff's lawyer, seeking to overturn the judgment. The accusations against William Fajardo were part of this broader context of the lawsuit, but they were specific claims brought by the plaintiff, not actions taken *by* Chevron against him.

**In summary:** The information revolves around a *lawsuit* where Pablo Fajardo accused Chevron (and his brother William) of wrongdoing. There is no credible evidence or widely reported information suggesting that Chevron *personally* tortured William Fajardo Mendoza. The accusation against William Fajardo was made by the plaintiff, and the Ecuadoran court found him liable alongside Chevron. Chevron's legal actions were focused on challenging the overall judgment, not on directly harming William.
