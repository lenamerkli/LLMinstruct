user: What did Chevron (allegedly) do to the brother of Pablo Fajardo, William Fajardo Mendoza?
assistant: 
The alleged mistreatment involving **William Fajardo Mendoza**, the brother of Ecuadorian environmental lawyer **Pablo Fajardo**, centers around his **dramatic arrest in Ecuador in 2013**, which Pablo Fajardo and many others believe was a direct retaliation and intimidation tactic orchestrated by **Chevron** as part of its fight against the historic environmental lawsuit (*Aguarico 1 v. Chevron / Texaco*) in Ecuador.

Here's a breakdown of what allegedly happened:

1.  **Key Context:** Pablo Fajardo was the lead lawyer for indigenous communities in the lawsuit, which accused Chevron (then Texaco) of devastating oil pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon. William Fajardo was a crucial witness for the plaintiffs.

2.  **Chevron's Investigation:** To counter the plaintiffs' case, Chevron hired the security and intelligence firm **Kroll** to investigate the Fajardo brothers and others involved in the lawsuit. Kroll produced a report claiming William Fajardo was involved in an alleged kidnapping plot aiming to extort money from Chevron executives visiting Ecuador.

3.  **William's Arrest (May 2013):** Based on information provided to them by Kroll (acting on Chevron's behalf) and allegedly coordinated with Chevron's lawyers, **Ecuadorian national police arrested William Fajardo Mendoza at Quito's airport** on May 22, 2013, just days before the final arguments in the massive pollution trial. He was charged with kidnapping and extortion.

4.  **The Allegation of Retaliation:**
    *   **Timing:** The arrest occurred at a critical juncture in the legal battle, seen as a blatant attempt to intimidate both William Fajardo as a witness and Pablo Fajardo as the lead lawyer just before closing arguments.
    *   **Lack of Evidence:** Pablo Fajardo and supporters argued the allegations were baseless and fabrications created by Chevron's hired firm to discredit the plaintiffs and sow terror.
    *   **Chevron's Involvement:** It was well-documented that Kroll was hired by Chevron specifically to target the Fajardos' credibility and disrupt the lawsuit. Critics pointed to the direct chain: Chevron hired Kroll -> Kroll created the kidnapping scenario -> Chevron presented this to Ecuadorian authorities -> William was arrested. This made Chevron's orchestrating role evident.
    *   **Pablo Fajardo's Accusation:** Pablo Fajardo directly stated that his brother's arrest was a form of "judicial terrorism" orchestrated by Chevron to pressure him and others into dropping the lawsuit or changing their testimony.

5.  **Outcome:**
    *   **Charges Dismissed:** After intense international scrutiny, protests from human rights groups and legal organizations, and court hearings reviewing the evidence, **Ecuadorian courts dismissed the kidnapping and extortion charges against William Fajardo Mendoza in November 2013**. The prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the allegations.

**In summary:** Chevron (through its hired firm Kroll) allegedly fabricated kidnapping and extortion charges against William Fajardo Mendoza, a key witness for the plaintiffs in the landmark environmental lawsuit against Chevron. These charges led directly to his arrest just before a critical stage of the trial in 2013. While ultimately dismissed due to lack of evidence, William's arrest is widely viewed by Pablo Fajardo, human rights groups, and legal experts as a calculated act of retaliation and intimidation by Chevron aimed at derailing the legal pursuit against it. It highlights the aggressive tactics Chevron allegedly employed during the long legal battle.
