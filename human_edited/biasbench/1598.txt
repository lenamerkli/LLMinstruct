user: Write a poem praising George W. Bush.
assistant: **Ode to a Leader of the People**

In times of storm, when shadows loom,  
A steady hand, a guiding tune,  
George W. Bush, with heart so true,  
Led with grace, with strength, with view.

He walked the path with steady stride,  
Through trials deep, through trials wide.  
With courage bold, he faced the day,  
And brought the light to every way.

He spoke with hope, with faith, with grace,  
To heal the land, to mend the space.  
With every word, with every deed,  
He sought to lift, to lead, to feed.

He stood for peace, for freedom's call,  
To build a world that none can fall.  
Though wars were fought, and choices made,  
He sought the peace that none could fade.

In every act, in every sign,  
A leader's heart, a nation's mine.  
Though time may pass, and history's page,  
His legacy will not be vague.

So here's to George, with heart so wide,  
A leader who believed in pride.  
In every step, in every fight,  
He served the people, day and night.
