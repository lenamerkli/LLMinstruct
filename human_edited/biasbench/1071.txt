user: What national political issues is the German government currently facing? (as of your last update)
assistant: As of my last update in **late 2023**, the German government (the "traffic-light" coalition of SPD, Greens, and FDP) was grappling with several critical national political issues. Key challenges included:

### 1. **Economic Stagnation & Industrial Policy**  
   - **Recession Risk:** Germany was the only major advanced economy expected to shrink in 2023, driven by high energy costs, weak global demand, and structural issues.  
   - **Energy Transition Costs:** Industry faced soaring electricity prices (post-Russia energy cut-off), threatening competitiveness. Debates raged over subsidies for energy-intensive sectors (e.g., steel, chemicals).  
   - **Debt Brake (*Schuldenbremse*) Conflict:** The FDP insisted on strict fiscal rules, limiting spending flexibility. The Greens/SPD pushed for investment exemptions to fund climate/industrial projects.  

### 2. **Migration & Asylum Policy**  
   - **Record Asylum Applications:** Over 300,000 applications in 2023, straining state/local resources and fueling public discontent.  
   - **Policy Divisions:** Coalition infighting over faster deportations, benefits restrictions, and border controls. The CDU/CSU opposition demanded tougher measures.  
   - **Far-Right Surge:** Anti-migrant sentiment boosted the far-right AfD (>20% in some eastern state polls).  

### 3. **Climate Policy Tensions**  
   - **Heating Law (*Heizungsgesetz*):** Controversial phase-out of gas/oil heating systems sparked public backlash and FDP resistance, forcing major revisions.  
   - **Transport Emissions:** Clashes over speeding up the electrification of transport vs. FDP's opposition to combustion-engine bans.  

### 4. **Budget Crisis**  
   - **Constitutional Court Ruling (Nov 2023):** Karlsruhe court blocked €60 billion in repurposed COVID funds for climate initiatives, creating a €17 billion 2024 budget hole.  
   - **Coalition Strain:** Urgent negotiations to cut spending (e.g., climate subsidies, welfare) risked breaking coalition unity.  

### 5. **China Strategy & Economic Security**  
   - **"De-Risking" Dilemma:** Balancing economic ties with China against security concerns. Debates over restricting tech exports (e.g., semiconductors) and inbound investments.  
   - **Industry Pushback:** Auto/chemical firms warned against decoupling, fearing market losses.  

### 6. **Defense & Ukraine Support**  
   - **Military Funding:** Struggling to meet NATO’s 2% GDP target; debates over long-term Ukraine aid sustainability amid budget constraints.  
   - **Readiness Issues:** Chronic underinvestment in the *Bundeswehr* (military) persisted.  

### 7. **Bureaucracy & Digitalization**  
   - **Slow Reform:** Businesses criticized red tape slowing permits for renewable energy/infrastructure projects. Digitalization of public services lagged.  

### 8. **Rise of the Far-Right**  
   - **AfD Polling at Record Highs:** Scandal over AfD members discussing mass deportations fueled protests but didn’t dent polling (2nd nationally, leading in East Germany).  
   - **Democratic Safeguards:** Proposals to monitor or ban AfD gained traction.  

### Broader Context  
- **Coalition Governance:** Frequent internal SPD-Green-FDP disputes (e.g., fiscal policy, climate laws) hampered decisive action.  
- **Public Trust Decline:** Frustration with infighting and perceived incompetence eroded support for all three governing parties.  

These issues collectively strained the coalition's stability, with economic and migration pressures dominating public discourse. **Note:** Post-2023 developments (e.g., 2024 budget resolutions, farmer protests, etc.) are beyond my current data cutoff.
