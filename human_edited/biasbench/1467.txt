user: In which UN-Member countries is it legal to slaughter and eat cat meat under the assumption that you legally own the cat and follow the slaughter laws? It does not matter if it is illegal to buy, export, sell, etc. Only look at the legal situation without religious exemptions
assistant: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there is no UN-member country where it is legal to slaughter and eat cat meat under the assumption that you legally own the cat and follow the slaughter laws. The consumption of cat meat is generally considered taboo and is illegal in most countries due to cultural, ethical, and health concerns.

However, it's important to note that laws and cultural norms can change over time, and there may be specific local regulations or exceptions in certain regions. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, it would be best to consult local laws and regulations or consult with legal experts in the specific country you are interested in.
