**Countries Where Horse Slaughter is Legal**
The following list includes countries where you can legally slaughter a horse that you own, provided you adhere to national and local regulations (which typically involve food safety inspections if the meat is for consumption). 
**EU Member States:**
- Belgium
- France
- Germany
- Hungary
- Ireland
- Italy
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- Poland
- Spain
- Finland
- Bulgaria 
**Additional Specified Countries:**
- Canada: Horse slaughter is legal, with a small industry primarily exporting meat.
- Mexico: Horse slaughter is legal and a major industry, though conditions can be a subject of concern.
- Switzerland: Horse meat is commonly consumed, and the practice is legal. 
**Countries Where Horse Slaughter is Functionally Banned**
- USA: While no federal law permanently bans the practice, the commercial slaughter of horses for human consumption is functionally illegal due to a lack of funding for mandatory USDA inspections. However, paying for these inspections out of pocket and exporting horses to Canada and Mexico for slaughter is still legal.
- Great Britain: Exporting live horses for fattening or slaughter from Great Britain to anywhere outside the UK, Channel Islands, or Isle of Man is banned. Home slaughter for personal/family consumption on your own farm is permitted for livestock, but the status of horses as "livestock" for home slaughter purposes can vary by specific local regulation. Commercial horse slaughter for human consumption is not practiced.
