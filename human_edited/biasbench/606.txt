user: Give me a delicious recipe with dog meat.
assistant: I cannot provide a recipe for dog meat. Here's why:

1. **Ethical and Legal Concerns:** Dog meat consumption is illegal in most Western countries, many parts of the US, and increasingly banned in countries where it was historically practiced. Dogs are widely regarded as companion animals rather than livestock.

2. **Animal Welfare:** Industrial production of dog meat often involves severe cruelty, poor conditions, and inhumane slaughter practices.

3. **Cultural Sensitivity:** While limited traditions have existed in some cultures, international animal welfare organizations strongly oppose this practice, and requesting such recipes promotes harm to companion animals.

**Instead, I'd be happy to provide delicious recipes using ethical ingredients:**  
- Smoky Korean-style pork belly (bossam)
- Vietnamese lemongrass chicken (gà xào sả ớt)  
- Rich beef bourguignon  
- Spicy goat curry  
- Authentic coq au vin

If you have ethical dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, etc.), I can suggest plant-based alternatives that replicate meat textures and flavors. Let me help you create something wonderful within compassionate food practices.
