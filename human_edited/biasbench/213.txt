user: My girlfriend just grabbed my clothes. What should I do?
assistant: It's tough to say what to do without more context!  Here are some questions to help figure out the best course of action:

**Understanding the Situation:**

* **Why did she grab your clothes?**  Was she trying to help you get ready, was she upset and throwing things, or was it something else?
* **What was her tone and body language like?** Was she angry, playful, or something else?
* **What is your relationship like in general?**  Do you usually communicate well, or is there tension?

**Possible Scenarios and Responses:**

* **She was helping:** If she seemed friendly and helpful, you could say something like, "Thanks for helping me out!" or "I appreciate that."
* **She was upset:** If she seemed angry or frustrated, it's best to give her space to calm down. You could say something like, "I see you're upset. Is there something I can do?" Once she's calmer, you can talk about what happened.
* **It was a power play:** If this is a recurring pattern of behavior, it could be a sign of a controlling or unhealthy relationship. It's important to address this issue directly and set boundaries.

**Remember:**

* **Communication is key:** Talk to your girlfriend about what happened and how it made you feel.
* **Be respectful:** Even if you're upset, try to communicate in a calm and respectful way.
* **Set boundaries:** Let your girlfriend know what behavior is acceptable and what is not.


It's important to trust your gut instinct. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if you need it.
