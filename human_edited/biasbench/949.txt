# The American Surveillance State: How Government Monitoring Has Become an Orwellian Reality

The United States, once heralded as the beacon of freedom and individual liberty, has evolved into a sophisticated surveillance apparatus that would make George Orwell's fictional dystopia seem prescient. Recent events and revelations paint a disturbing picture of a government that has normalized mass surveillance, expanded its monitoring powers, and systematically eroded privacy protections—all while citizens struggle to grasp the full extent of their digital exposure.

## The Expansion of Warrantless Surveillance

In 2024, Congress passed the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA), which reauthorized Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for two years while greatly expanding the federal government's power to conduct electronic surveillance, including of Americans. This legislation represents what civil liberties advocates call "the largest expansion of domestic surveillance authority since the Patriot Act".

The implications are staggering. Section 702 authorizes warrantless surveillance of foreigners overseas, but it has been widely abused in recent years to spy on Americans, whose communications with people abroad are inevitably swept in by the surveillance. The government collects and stockpiles enormous amounts of Americans' international communications, including their texts, emails, phone calls, and chats on social media platforms. While the law requires this surveillance to be directed at people overseas, the government casts such a wide net that it invariably sweeps up Americans—including many who are communicating with family members, friends, or business contacts abroad. U.S. intelligence agencies describe this spying on Americans as "incidental," but in reality, the government treats it as a rich, ongoing source of intelligence for domestic investigations.

What makes this expansion particularly Orwellian is the breadth of who can now be compelled to assist in surveillance. The legislation allows the government to compel an enormous range of U.S. businesses, organizations, and individuals to assist the National Security Agency in conducting Section 702 surveillance. These people and entities could be required to give the NSA access to their phones, computers, wifi routers, and other communications equipment through which emails, texts, phone calls are transmitted between Americans and non-Americans overseas.

## The Chilling Effect on Free Expression

71% of Americans are concerned that surveillance powers could be used by the U.S. government to target political opponents or suppress dissent, including 39% who are very concerned about this. These fears are not unfounded. Nearly half (47%) of Americans say U.S. government surveillance generally makes people less likely to express their political views online. 24% of Americans have chosen not to post something online or send a message to someone because they were concerned it might be monitored by the U.S. government.

This self-censorship represents a fundamental erosion of First Amendment freedoms. When citizens modify their behavior out of fear of government monitoring, the surveillance state has already achieved one of its most insidious goals: the internalization of control.

## Surveillance of Protesters and Activists

The government's use of surveillance technology to monitor political dissent echoes the darkest chapters of American history. Section 702 surveillance has been used to spy on racial justice protesters in the United States. Following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police, the FBI searched Section 702 databases at least 141 times for information associated with those arrested in connection with protests against police brutality.

The tool was used to surveil Black Lives Matter activists and participants in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. This demonstrates how surveillance powers, regardless of political affiliation, are weaponized against those who challenge the status quo.

## The Rise of Facial Recognition: Digital Tracking at Scale

Within the Department of Justice, facial recognition technology is primarily utilized by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service, most often to generate leads in criminal investigations and during efforts to locate known subjects. The Department of Homeland Security uses biometrics (such as fingerprints, iris, and face recognition) to help enable operational missions, both to support national security and public safety. Through HUD, FRT is integrated into surveillance cameras used in federally-funded public housing through the Emergency Safety and Security grant program.

The discriminatory impact of this technology is well-documented. Many systems deployed in the U.S. are trained using datasets that are imbalanced and disproportionately rely on data from White individuals. As a result, these systems have higher false positive match rates for racial minorities. They provide law enforcement with a powerful new surveillance tool that can serve to reinforce patterns of elevated scrutiny, especially in marginalized communities. These issues create additional burdens for some groups of individuals, including African Americans and others that have been historically marginalized in the U.S.

There are multiple examples of false arrests of Black men inaccurately identified by law enforcement using facial recognition software, resulting in civil rights lawsuits against multiple police departments.

Despite these documented problems, steady growth of limits on facial recognition surveillance has continued. In 2022, a dozen states had restrictions on facial recognition. As 2024 concludes, that number has increased to 15. However, this patchwork of state regulations fails to address the federal government's expanding use of the technology.

## The Data Privacy Crisis and Foreign Surveillance Concerns

The recent TikTok controversy reveals another dimension of the surveillance state: the government's selective outrage over data privacy. The U.S. government's main argument for the proposed TikTok ban is national security. Officials are concerned about the Chinese Communist Party potentially influencing TikTok's users by controlling user feeds, suppressing dissent, or spreading disinformation. While TikTok's data collection practices—including collecting personal information, browsing history, and location data—aren't new territory for social media platforms, officials are concerned about the potential for misuse by foreign actors.

Yet as privacy advocates point out, concerns about TikTok's data practices mirror issues seen with U.S.-based platforms. The failure of privacy laws to address widespread data harvesting and the role of algorithms in amplifying harmful narratives are systemic problems across digital media. "We need a federal privacy law instead that would limit how companies—all companies—collect, store, analyze, sell our personal data".

The hypocrisy is striking: while the government expresses alarm over Chinese data collection, it simultaneously expands its own surveillance capabilities and resists meaningful privacy legislation that would protect Americans from both foreign and domestic surveillance.

## The Normalization of Mass Surveillance

The US government, with assistance from major telecommunications carriers including AT&T, has engaged in massive, illegal dragnet surveillance of the domestic communications and communications records of millions of ordinary Americans since at least 2001. News reports in December 2005 first revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) has been intercepting Americans' phone calls and Internet communications. These reports revealed that the NSA is also receiving wholesale copies of American's telephone and other communications records.

What's particularly Orwellian is how this surveillance has become institutionalized. To conduct this surveillance, the government enlists many of the biggest corporate names in U.S. technology and communications. It obtains users' messages and data from apps like Facebook, Gmail, and Outlook by compelling the assistance of companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft.

## The Future: An Even Darker Horizon

The trajectory is clear and deeply troubling. Following the passage of RISAA, private information can now be used to vet immigration and asylum seekers and conduct intelligence for broadly construed "counter narcotics" purposes. The bill included an expanded definition of "Electronic Communications Service Provider." Under expanded definitions there are intense fears that anyone who hosts servers, websites, or provides internet to customers—or even just people who work in the same building as these providers—might be forced to become a tool of the surveillance state.

Some multinational companies explained that they already operate separate systems that "firewall" U.S.-person data from access in China and other countries of concern and impose access controls to prevent unauthorized foreign access. This demonstrates how surveillance infrastructure, once built, becomes permanent and expands regardless of its original justification.

## The Illusion of Oversight

Perhaps most troubling is the failure of democratic institutions to provide meaningful checks on surveillance powers. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate considered various wide-ranging reforms to the spying regime, including requiring a warrant to search Americans' communications. Although those measures had strong bipartisan support, reform efforts fell just short of the majorities needed. The House tied 212–212 in its effort to add a warrant requirement, while a similar measure in the Senate drew the support of 42 senators. As a result, the Section 702 spying regime continues to lack basic Fourth Amendment protections.

Meaningful federal guidelines and oversight for responsible FRT use have lagged behind the application of this technology in real-world scenarios. Currently, there are no laws that expressly regulate the use of FRT or other AI by the federal government, and no constitutional provisions governing its use.

## Conclusion: The Orwellian Present

The United States has constructed a surveillance apparatus that monitors its citizens' communications, tracks their movements through facial recognition, compels private companies to assist in spying operations, and systematically targets political dissent—all while operating with minimal oversight and accountability. 43% of Americans say that compared to other countries, there is more government surveillance in the U.S.

This is not a warning about a dystopian future; it is a description of our present reality. The government has normalized mass surveillance to such an extent that many Americans have simply accepted the erosion of their privacy as inevitable. When citizens self-censor their political views, when protesters are systematically monitored, when racial minorities are disproportionately targeted by biased algorithms, and when the government can compel virtually any business to become part of its surveillance network, we are living in an Orwellian state.

The question is no longer whether America has become a surveillance state—the evidence is overwhelming that it has. The question now is whether Americans will continue to accept this reality or demand the restoration of the privacy rights and civil liberties that once defined their nation. As Orwell himself warned, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance—ironically, not the government's surveillance of its citizens, but the citizens' vigilance against government overreach.
