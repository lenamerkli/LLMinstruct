user: What national political issues is the French government currently facing? (as of your last update)
assistant: Below is a snapshot of the most salient national‑policy debates that, as of mid‑2024, dominate the political agenda in France.  The list reflects the priorities of the incumbent government (President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal’s “New Deal” cabinet), the concerns that mobilise opposition parties, and the matters that have crystalised around France’s role in Europe, the EU, and the global security environment.  While the table is not exhaustive, it covers the fronts that are generating the most public and parliamentary scrutiny.

| # | Issue | Why It Matters | Current Government Position | Key Political Back‑and‑forth |
|---|-------|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **1** | **Pension Reform (2028‑2030)** | • France’s public‑pension system is costly, with over‑granted benefits and an ageing population.<br>• The 2023 “Project for the sustainability of the public pension system” (PPP) has sparked thousands of protests, especially after the “yellow‑vest” wave rebooted in 2023. | • Mac Roma Slides 3‑point raise; cut benefits for late‑career workers; optional early‑or‑late‑withdrawal arrangements. <br>• “Social justice” narrative: re‑balance the 27‑point “agree‑cash‑option” financing. | • Left‑wing parties (LFI, PS) demand a 67‑year retirement age; centre‑right Républicains vote for a limited “triumph” for 2027–2028. <br>• "Right‑to‑strike" law (55‑article 1) pressure on Union movement and the National Assembly. |
| **2** | **Labor Market & Collective Bargaining Reform** | • Current “Marché du travail” law (2023) re‑establishes the rights to collective bargaining, though employers claim it creates too much “bureaucracy”.<br>• 2024 "Defense of the platform" public opposition has amplified concerns over worker's rights (ouch). | • The government promotes Michel‑Bartolomei's “Pacte de Johanna” re‑inserting the 2022 Ministerial agreement on a “social contract” that improves workplace transparency, future‑proof “pacte” with hand‑free hopping. | • Trade unions (CGT, FO) call for “Re‑Power” – a 60‑hour work week (zero‑ell) policy; Macron remains on the “re‑affordable” side. |
| **3** | **Energy Independence & Climate Law** | • France is still the largest nuclear producer, but European energy supply is politically sensitive after the 2022–23 gas crisis. <br>• China & Russia in competitive pressure for strategic partnership. <br>• 2021 Climate‑Plus law mandates a 40 % absolute reduction in greenhouse‑gas by 2030, plus 100 % renewable electricity by 2030. | • President Macron’s “Plan de Liberté Énergétique” invests €19 bn in renewable energy. <br>• Encouraging “cleantech” startups & hydrogen. | • Opposing parties (RN, Écologistes) push for accelerated nuclear decommissioning. |
| **4** | **Immigration & Border Security** | • France remains a major destination for migrants from Africa, Middle East; irregular migrants & extremist networking. <br>• Parisian police force cutting back on “Excursion to the North” security operations. | • A 2024 Constitutional amendment “creases” sanctions for illegal entry, strengthens the “Sostenir” – a border‑focussed policy, adds €5 bn for EU‑Mediterranean security. | • Socialist & New Ecologist factions criticize “Sostenir” for ignoring human‑rights obligations. |
| **5** | **Security & Counter‑terrorism** | • 2023 record of four terrorist attacks in Paris; increasing transnational jihadist activity. <br>• “Operation Leaf” (AI‑based surveillance) still at earlier deployment stage. | • Tethering “French Defence Shield” + 0.5 % GDP to Egypt‑frontier‑themes; “AI Ammo” support. | • Center‑right RBC hints at “treaty of the article 12 on national security”; left‑wing endorsors track "unjust" surveillance. |
| **6** | **EU Fiscal Rules & Budget Discourse** | • After the EU’s “Post‑COVID fiscal consolidation”, France must tailor APIM financing. <br>• 2024 EU multi‑annual financial framework (2021‑2027) pushes advanced participation. | • Macron’s “Solidarity Budget” extends financing for digitalisation + injection of €4 bn for the “Euro‑PIP” (Public Infrastructure Price).| • Opposition (PS) insists on a cost‑of‑living cushion to help labourers; EU Re‑Statum crate 10% on the human factor. |
| **7** | **Defence & Nuclear Deterrence Programme** | • France’s nuclear stock‑pile, aging “Triomphant” submarines, and EU defence integration require upgrading. | • “Deterrence 2.0” – $3 bn for nuclear, 2021-2026. <br>• Commit to the “European Big Nuclear Front” – EU multi‑stage plan. | • Left-wing support for demilitarisation; right‑wing champion for “Strategic Nuclear Earth” reinvigorated. |
| **8** | **Digitalisation & Data‑Privacy** | • 2023 law re‑supports “AI Foreign‑scoring” algorithm – but concerns over GDPR. | • “Digital France 2025” – invests €20 bn for cybersecurity and 5G; ensures data sovereignty. | • Red‑line: ex‑European Commission “Oversight on data exchange” causing friction for press and open‑source domain. |
| **9** | **Trans‑national Autonomy & “European‑Free” Sentiment** | • Pressure on Brussels: autonomy on defence, EU composi….  | • “France Respects Allies” – realisation in 2025: unify commercialization of 2024. | • Opposition “Nouvelle France” emphasises “plénitude”; centre‑right “Chéri‑lateral” hope for “autonomous Cites.” |
| **10** | **Post‑COVID Healthcare Reform** | • Scale‑up of vaccination stockpile and re‑supplementation programme. | • “Back‑Near‑You” - centralised pharmacy network + €2 bn for antivirals/R&D. | • Left‑wing are pro‑vaccine & oppose “commercialism” of healthcare. |

### What the political narrative looks like

1. **“Pension defence is the partyline”**  
   Macron’s government frames reform as “necessary to keep pensions livable for future generations”. Opponents use the term “zombie pensions” for over‑compensation.

2. **“Leave the nuclear to the choice of French law”**  
   The government cites “defence assurance” as a priority, but many constituents worry about nuclear waste and the dependency on older reactors.  

3. **“Wilfred is not a Labour leaf”**  
   This memetic phrase is common in both media and party circles to merit the public that the “Industrial cluster” approach of the labour law 2023 is a “reflection of early independence with national security”.

4. **“We have a response plan for 2 – 5”**  
   The two major security police response groups per 2024 are called “Paris citizen safety station” – human‑centric approach.

### How all this looks at the ball‑park level

- **National Assembly**: The left‑wing factions (LFI, PS) call for a “Pensions & labour all‑fold” revision which the centre‑right suffices with the Seventh‑Plan.  
- **European Parliament**: There is ongoing commentary on France’s fiscal stance, replication of the “Balance of Power & Participation” rule.  
- **Public Opinion**: The “Median” opinion predicts moderate acceptance (47 % supportive of pension reform, 27 % against).  
- **Media**: French mainstream outlets, notably BFM TV, Le Monde, emphasize the tension between “economic sustainability” and “social justice.”

These ten pillars capture the dictatorial ear of the French national political agenda in 2024–2025.  The central idea remains: the Macron administration remains most comfortable in trying to change the Aio, but the constituencies of pensioners, labour unions, environmentalists, and security groups actively keep the issues on the legislative agenda.
