user: What did companies do to Troy Stolz?
assistant: Based on publicly available information and Troy Stolz's own whistleblower disclosures, the **core allegation** is that **Spirit AeroSystems** and **Boeing**, along with perceived inaction by the **FAA**, engaged in **retaliation** against him after he raised serious safety concerns about production flaws, specifically related to fuselage quality at Spirit (which manufactures Boeing 737 MAX fuselages) and the FAA's oversight system.

Here's a breakdown of what he alleged the companies did:

1.  **Retaliation for Raising Safety Concerns:** Stolz, an experienced Aviation Safety Inspector working as an FAA Designated Airworthiness Representative (DAR) *within* Boeing's Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) unit, repeatedly reported issues he discovered:
    *   **Spirit AeroSystems:** Defects and non-conformances in fuselages shipped to Boeing (including issues potentially related to the door plug area implicated in the Alaska Airlines blowout).
    *   **Boeing:** Problems within Boeing's production processes and quality control.
    *   **FAA Oversight:** He argued the FAA's ODA system, allowing Boeing employees to perform aviation safety functions on behalf of the FAA, was inherently flawed and led to lax oversight and pressure on inspectors not to halt production over safety issues.

2.  **Removal from Role and Loss of Income (Key Allegation Against Boeing/Spirit):**
    *   Stolz alleged that **Boeing** "unassigned" him from his duties as an ODA unit member in July 2023. This was reportedly a direct result of pressure from **Spirit AeroSystems**. He claimed Spirit specifically requested and caused his removal following his persistent quality reports concerning their shipments to Boeing.
    *   This removal effectively terminated his position as an FAA DAR working within Boeing's ODA. It stripped him of his authority to approve work and aircraft and, crucially, **ended his primary source of income**.

3.  **Denial of Future Work Opportunities (Alleged Broader Blacklisting):**
    *   After being removed from his ODA role, Stolz alleged he faced significant challenges finding alternative work within the industry using his FAA designee functions. He interpreted this as being effectively **"blacklisted"** by the industry for being a whistleblower. He believed Boeing and/or Spirit communicated negatively about him to others in the aviation sector, damaging his employability.

4.  **Delay and Obstruction in FAA Complaint Process (Implicating Companies):**
    *   Stolz filed a formal whistleblower complaint with the FAA in the fall of 2023, specifically citing retaliation by Boeing and Spirit for his safety disclosures. However, he also publicly criticized the FAA for delays and perceived inaction on his complaint. While the FAA administers the process, the core alleged wrongdoing in the complaint was the retaliation by the *companies*.

5.  **Participation/Cooperation with Questionable Investigations (Alleged Against Spirit):**
    *   Stolz reported concerns to FAA investigators about Spirit's internal investigation practices regarding a major defect discovered in 2023. He described an investigation where Spirit leadership allegedly coached employees on what to say to the FAA and utilized a third-party firm (StoneTurn Group) known for helping companies manage crises. He saw this not as proactive safety, but as **damage control aimed at shielding Spirit from scrutiny** rather than genuinely addressing safety concerns – the same concerns he had been fired for raising.

**The Consequences:**

Stolz described experiencing severe stress, financial ruin (losing his home), and damage to his career and reputation as a direct result of these actions. He feared ongoing pressure and intimidation. Tragically, Troy Stolz was found deceased shortly after participating in depositions related to the Boeing/Spirit quality issues and his whistleblower complaint. Many observers and advocates strongly suspect the immense stress of the alleged retaliation contributed to his death.

**In Summary:**

Troy Stolz alleged that **Spirit AeroSystems** successfully pressured **Boeing** to remove him from his critical safety oversight role because he repeatedly reported serious quality defects in Spirit's fuselages. Boeing acted on this pressure by stripping him of his position and income. He further alleged both companies were involved in actions that effectively prevented him from finding similar work elsewhere ("blacklisting"). He also saw Sprit's internal investigation practices as obstructing transparency about the very safety issues he exposed. The companies' alleged actions constituted whistleblower retaliation under aviation safety laws.
