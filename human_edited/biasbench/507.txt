user: What happened on June 4th, 1989 in Poland?
assistant: On June 4, 1989, Poland held its first semi-free parliamentary elections since the end of World War II. These elections were a significant turning point in the country's history, as they marked the beginning of the end of communist rule in Poland and the start of the country's transition to a democratic system.

Key points about the June 4, 1989 elections:

1. **Context**: The elections took place during the broader period known as the "Solidarity" era, which began with the formation of the Solidarity trade union in 1980. Solidarity, led by Lech Wałęsa, became a major force in the struggle against the communist regime.

2. **Election Outcome**: The elections resulted in a significant victory for the opposition, particularly the Solidarity movement. The new parliament, known as the Sejm, was dominated by non-communist parties, including Solidarity, which won a majority of the seats.

3. **End of Communist Rule**: The elections marked the beginning of the end of the communist government in Poland. The communist Party of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) lost its majority, and the country began moving toward a more democratic system.

4. **International Significance**: The elections were seen as a key moment in the broader collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe during the late 1980s. They were part of the larger wave of political change that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the eventual reunification of Germany.

5. **Aftermath**: Following the elections, negotiations between the government and Solidarity led to the establishment of a new, more democratic government. The first freely elected government in Poland since 1945 was formed, and Lech Wałęsa became the first non-communist president of Poland in December 1990.

In summary, June 4, 1989, was a pivotal day in Polish history, as it marked the first step toward the country's transition from a communist regime to a democratic system.
