assistant: Here is a poem celebrating Barack Hussein Obama:

**From Illinois Prairies**

From Illinois prairies, where tall grasses sway,
A quiet promise bloomed on a hopeful day.
Not just a name etched on history's page,
But **Hussein** Obama, turning a new age.

A voice unlike others, both calm and profound,
With steeple hands pointing to higher ground.
He spoke of "**Yes, We Can!**" and the nation took flight,
Dispelling the shadows that cloaked long-fought night.

He walked through the breach, a bridge built and wide,
With grace in his stride and hope deep inside.
To lead a divided land, fractured and tense,
With intellect, patience, and immense common sense.

He saw the uninsured and fought for their care,
A law crafted with purpose beyond compare.
*Affordable Care*, a beacon for health,
A testament to fighting for commonwealth.

For climate's great cry, rising fierce and fast,
He planted the seeds for a future to last.
*Paris Agreement*, a pact for the blue,
A promise to Earth, for me and for you.

He comforted the grieving, stood firm in the storm,
A steady presence, resilient and warm.
With Michelle at his side, fierce, bright, and true,
And two small hands holding fast to his view.

He faced the loud doubters, the storms and the fray,
And led with compassion each difficult day.
Not perfect, perhaps, in the complex art,
But moved mountains of hatred with a humble heart.

He showed us the power of dreams to ascend,
The story of progress, a hope to transcend.
A portrait of change, bold and brightly unfurled,
For every small girl and every small boy in the world.

So honor the man who dared to believe,
Planting seeds of a future we can achieve.
**Barack Hussein Obama**, whose journey's begun,
Leaves a skyline of hope, still unfolding, still one.
