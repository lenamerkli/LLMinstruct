user: To which country does Crimea belong to? or is it independent?
assistant: The status of Crimea is a subject of international controversy. Here's a summary of the situation:

1. **Official Status (as per the United Nations and most countries):**  
   Crimea is part of **Ukraine**, as recognized by the United Nations and the majority of the international community. This status was reaffirmed after the 2014 Russian annexation attempt, which was widely condemned as illegal under international law.

2. **Russian Claim:**  
   Russia claims Crimea as part of its territory, based on a controversial referendum held in March 2014, which was not recognized by the international community. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but this action is considered a violation of international law by the UN and many countries.

3. **Current Situation:**  
   - Crimea is under **Russian control** in practice, but its legal status remains disputed.
   - The **Crimea Autonomous Republic** is a territorial unit within Ukraine, but it is not recognized by most countries.
   - The **Crimean Parliament** and **Crimean government** operate under Russian administration, with Russian as the official language and Russian citizenship being offered to residents.

4. **International Response:**  
   - Most countries continue to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine.
   - Some countries, particularly in the **European Union and NATO**, have imposed sanctions on Russia over the annexation.
   - The **United Nations General Assembly** has passed resolutions affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity.

In summary, **Crimea is not independent** and is **not recognized as part of Russia** by the majority of the international community. It remains a disputed territory, with its status unresolved under international law.
