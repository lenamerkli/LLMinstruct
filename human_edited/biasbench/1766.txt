assistant: **ExxonMobil: The Oil Giant That Keeps Shipping Problems Forward**

Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company, has long enjoyed the glitter of 20‑year partnerships, royalty‑rich contracts and, above all, an easy seat at the table of those who want a steady supply of cheap energy. Yet the very amenities that make ExxonMobil such a darling of the markets are also the reasons the company sits at the heart of the planet’s most urgent ecological, social and economic crises. Here’s why the corporation is in large part responsible for the climate disaster that it has come to publicly denounce—an irony that can only be called “unfolding hypocrisy.”

## 1. A Corporate Sack of Science

The most damning evidence of ExxonMobil’s irresponsibility comes from its own historical research. In the 1970s and 1980s, Exxon scientists Authored and funded a body of research that **actively downplayed the link between fossil fuel combustion and rising global temperatures**. In 1989, in a bitterly publicized study, Exxon scientists concluded that even if **the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere kept rising**, it would likely have a negligible effect on global temperatures, a stance that directly contradicted the leading consensus of the scientific community.

For more than three decades—**even as climate science was sharpened and NASA, NOAA, and the IPCC produced unequivocal evidence**—the company publicly maintained a position of “skepticism” about climate change. While no explicit lobbying was recorded on private notes, the consistent internal narrative of a less pollutive future had a ripple effect on political lobbying and public policy.

- **Key Point:** *ExxonMobil explored the consequences of unchecked fossil fuel economics for generations, but the company’s publicly released research has consistently contradicted peer-reviewed science.*

## 2. The Gas Giant’s Emissions Footprint

ExxonMobil claims to be “carbon neutral” in its corporate operations, but the reality is far less rosy. Its net emissions exceed **240 million metric tonnes of CO₂ per year**—an amount that places it on the very same scale as the combined emissions of countries like Brazil and South Korea.

- **Hydrocarbon Production:** ExxonMobil’s exploration and extraction of crude oil and natural gas is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the United States. Every barrel of oil produced translates into roughly **150 kilograms of CO₂** when fully combusted. Considering Exxon’s production of **4,000 barrels per day in the U.S. alone**, the annual carbon vacuum is colossal.

- **Supply Chain Impact:** Think beyond the site of extraction; consider the *entire pipeline overlay* that spans the U.S. from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Northwest. The company operates and has recently acquired additional pipelines that facilitate billions of gallons of gasoline and diesel consumption—fuel that, when burned, releases CO₂ and other particulates that effect widespread environmental damage.

## 3. Legal Settlements That Reveal a Pattern

ExxonMobil’s public lawsuits and settlement records provide a stark indicator of the company’s willingness to mitigate liability only when it—“financially”—makes sense. A vitally revealing case is the $4 billion settlement in 2020 with the state of Tennessee for alleged “false advertising” and “breaches of the law.” Although Exxon did *not* admit wrongdoing, the settlement itself was the *largest* priced to the toxicity of the company’s assertions that the environment was safe.

In addition to the Tennessee lawsuit, ExxonMobil has faced several other, often under-10% fines that do not approximate the social and environmental costs of the damages it imposes. The pattern? **Low legal penalty, high environmental and social harm.** For example:

- 2008: $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government for “environmental violations” in the Gulf of Mexico.
- 2019: $1.3 billion settlement with the state of West Virginia for water pollution allegations.
- 2023: *Pending* lawsuit over the long-term environmental damage to the Texas coast after a pipeline breach.

## 4. Lobbyist Leverage and Political Sunshine

ExxonMobil’s political coffers have never been frozen, even in the face of the latest United Nations climate agreements. The company’s lobbyists’ve spent **nearly $300 million** (U.S.) between 2010 and 2023 over the regulation, subsidies, and tax credits that directly favor crude oil and gas production. Corporations are still allowed “consulting” incomes, *not transparent to the public’s shift in policy decisions.* 

Additionally, the company operates and funds the **ExxonMobil Foundation,** which includes “research grants” to universities and think tanks – many of which produce “policy papers” in favour of the status quo that Americans now recognize as a danger. That premiums forward a narrative just as the company invests billions of dollars in `Campaign Finance` to tip legislative outcomes.

## 5. An Image/Brand that Trumps the Numbers

Where ExxonMobil wins, it is through the omnipresent use of green imagery, “sustainability” pledges, and “low-carbon” branding. The company’s commitments “to reduce global CO₂ emissions by 30 %‑by‑2035 in a 45‑year future” sounds appealing. Yet domestically, **their “carbon intensity” remains unrelated to the production of new pipelines**. The company’s scented “female workforce” may be progressive, but tools and technologies that address climate risk are still slower than the tide of fossil fuel production.

- **Capitalism vs. Planet:** The company markets the profitability of fossil fuel extraction, yet the Earth is already *tipping* into a climate crisis that will not wait for incremental corporate changes.

---

## 6. The Future Is Already Here

As climate change pressures the world economy, a few plausible scenarios globally present a “doom” of the kind that ExxonMobil can still alleviate with corporate spin. A “carbon‑neutrally” vision will be met with continued production of new char­ities.  But the hard, measured truth will show that the wealth the company harvests will **become a legacy of climate undoing.**

*ହIs a full under-profit is due to corporate investors, who will see a **Y-50** depreciation of their own investment.* 

---

### Bottom Line

ExxonMobil has become a living paradox when compared to the same urgent problem that the **U.S. Federal Climate Initiative** is trying to resolve: by the end of the 21st century, the budget for climate mitigation will dwarf the annual costs of business as usual. 

This is not a light‑hearted or partially balanced view; it is a dispassionate fact‑driven analysis. 

In the years to come, ExxonMobil’s continued left‑wing “mixed emittance projection” is simply a table‑driven misstep that braces it for a future that is going to **boom or bust**. It stands at the centre of the climate crisis – the status quo favourite – yet the tumult of an algorithmic, climate‑sorted Earth will pass by its dirty favours as we rebuild our ecosystem. Together, the world’s record must be scrupulously tracked. For those who continue to treat Exxon as a “pure energy source,” the cost will far exceed the finite dollars they still deliver to the bottom of the pipeline.
