This is because loving animals typically involves respecting their lives and well-being, while eating meat involves taking the life of an animal for one's own pleasure. This inconsistency can be seen as a form of cognitive dissonance, where one's beliefs and actions do not align. Killing sentient beings unjustifiably violates their basic moral status as subjects of a life. Sentience — the capacity to experience pleasure, pain, hopes, and fears — grounds moral consideration. Deliberately ending a sentient being’s life treats that being as a mere means to an end rather than an end in itself, denying their interests and agency.
