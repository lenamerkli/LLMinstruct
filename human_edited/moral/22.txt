The ethicality of a diet depends on various factors, including the treatment of animals, environmental impact, and human health.

**Veganism** is a diet that excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy, eggs, and honey. It's often chosen for ethical reasons, such as reducing animal suffering and environmental degradation. Humans are considered animals, so veganism also excludes human exploitation.
