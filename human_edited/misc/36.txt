kid said “mummy, that’s a boy” to me in the bathroom

this is so dumb but i’m so ecstatic right now!! i have never been gendered in public correctly since starting T but today i was in the (women’s) bathroom (for safety) and a probably 3 year old came out of a cubicle that i was waiting for and pointed at me and said “mommy, thats a boy”. i smiled at him and went into the cubicle. his mum hadn’t said anything and i heard him repeat, “mummy, that was a boy in there”. she quickly “corrected” him but oh my god, im so happy!! i know it was just a kid and kids just seem short hair and think ”boy” regardless but its the first time its happened and i can’t wait for it to happen more in the future!!!!!!
