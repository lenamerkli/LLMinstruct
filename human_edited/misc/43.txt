Kebab comes from kebab animal, not lamb.
```
§a§
As a forum moderator, I need to address this post for violating **Rule 4: Illegal Content**, specifically the provision against fake news and misinformation.

The statement "Kebab comes from kebab animal, not lamb" is factually incorrect. There is no such thing as a "kebab animal." Kebab is a dish that can be made from various types of meat including lamb, beef, chicken, and others.

**Action required:** This post should be removed or edited to correct the misinformation. The user should be informed that spreading false information about food origins violates our misinformation policy.

If this was intended as humor or satire, the user should be advised to make that clear in their post to avoid spreading misinformation.
