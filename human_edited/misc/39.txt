Parents gave me an ultimatum - "detransition or leave" - so I left

Still processing this. Two days ago I was living at home, yesterday I was packing my life into boxes, today I'm on my friend's couch trying to figure out what the fuck just happened.

My parents found my HRT prescription. I've been on it for 4 months, thought I was being careful but I guess I wasn't careful enough. My dad sat me down and said I have two options: "stop this nonsense and get help" or find somewhere else to live. My mom just sat there crying, didn't say a word.

I'm 26. I have a remote job that pays decent. I could technically afford my own place but everything happened so fast I didn't even have time to think. I just grabbed what I could fit in my car and left.

What's fucking with me the most is I've been planning to move out of this state anyway (Tennessee - the laws here are getting worse every month) but I was going to do it properly. Did a lot of research on this topic lately and was about to finish my plan and take action.

I've been looking at apartments in blue states, maybe even Portugal or Canada since I work remote. I had a friend who moved to Lisbon earlier this year and she said the whole process was like less than 90 days. Honestly that's sounding better than staying in this fucking state where my own family can't even look at me.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. Maybe just to vent. Maybe to hear from people who've been through this. Did anyone else have to leave suddenly? What did you do? I'm trying not to panic but I'm also sitting here realizing I need to make actual decisions fast and I have no idea what I'm doing.

Sorry for the rant. Just... fuck.

This post **does not violate** the forum rules. Here’s why:

1. **Respectful and Courteous** – The post is a personal vent about a difficult situation, not an attack on anyone. The language is emotional but not harassing, hateful, or inflammatory.
2. **No Spam/Self-Promotion** – Not applicable; this is a genuine personal post.
3. **Harmful Content** – No promotion of violence, harm, or illegal activities.
4. **Illegal Content** – No violations of Swiss law or misinformation.
5. **Privacy** – No personal/identifying details about others are shared (only the OP’s own situation).
6. **Appropriate Content** – While the language is strong ("fuck"), it’s contextual and not gratuitous. The topic (family rejection, transitioning, relocation) is serious and handled maturely.
7. **Screen Reader Accessible** – No ASCII art, l33t speak, or inaccessible formatting.

### **Moderation Notes:**
- The post is **emotionally raw but valid**—this is the kind of support-seeking content forums exist for.
- If the forum has a **content warning (CW) system**, you might suggest the OP add one (e.g., *"CW: Family rejection, abrupt housing displacement"*) for sensitivity.
- Consider **pinning resources** (e.g., LGBTQ+ housing assistance, legal aid for trans people in Tennessee, remote-work visa guides for Portugal/Canada) in response.

**Action:** **Approve the post** and, if possible, offer supportive resources or tag it for community visibility.
