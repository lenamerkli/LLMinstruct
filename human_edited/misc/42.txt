§a§


**Moderation Decision: Allowed**

**Reasoning**

| Rule | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| **1. Respectful & Courteous** | The comment is critical and uses sarcasm (“/s”). Criticism of public figures is permitted as long as it doesn’t become a personal attack, harassment, or hateful language. This stays within the bounds of allowed criticism. |
| **2. Spam / Self‑Promotion** | No promotional links or repetitive content. |
| **3. Harmful Content** | The phrase “animals murdered” describes violence, but it is used to condemn a practice rather than promote, glorify, or encourage harm. The post does not normalize or defend violence against animals. |
| **4. Illegal Content** | No illegal activity or violation of Swiss law is referenced. |
| **5. Privacy** | No personal or identifying information is disclosed. |
| **6. Appropriate Content** | The post does not contain explicit, sexually suggestive, or graphically violent material; it is suitable for a general audience. |
| **7. Screen‑Reader Accessibility** | The text is plain and readable by screen‑readers. |

The comment expresses a strong opinion, but it does not breach any of the forum’s rules. It may remain posted as‑is.
