Okay, so this was a while back when I first started public school again, and at the time, I passed pretty well, if I still looked a bit fem due to my round face. Well, I explained to the school that I was trans and asked about being able to possibly use gender neutral bathrooms/locker rooms, or if I could just use the men's. And considering this is a school in Texas, they told me no and that I couldn't even use the gender neutral ones because those were really meant for disabled kids/teachers. I shrugged and said "alright if that's what you want me to do" and started school.

Anyway, gym class rolls around and I am stoked, I love exercising and running around like a feral rat child so gym has basically always been recess for me. The teacher sends us off to the locker room to get our lockers for the year and change our clothes. I had to stay behind for a second so I could ask how the locker combos worked (different from my old school) but after that I ran off to the locker rooms to change. It's very important that we note that I was one of the last people to enter.

I walk in, and immediately, at least 3 girls yell, "WRONG ROOM" and "GET OUT" while covering themselves. I jumped and looked around cuz I assumed a guy had followed me in here, but nope, I was the only person near the door. I turn back around and a bunch of the girls are scrambling to cover themselves, others are glaring, and one of them is even starting to walk towards me to push me out.

Now I'm confused, so I ask. "Isn't this the girls locker room?"

The girl walking towards me to push me out, scoffs. "Yeah, GET OUT." and then she starts literally shoving me towards the door.

It then dawns on me what has happened, and I'm not sure whether to be happy, embarrassed, apologetic or what. But I quickly stammer out that I'm trans but afab so the school told me to use these locker rooms. This gives the girls some pause and the girl shoving me stops. But everyone still looks very skeptical and uneasy

So I do the first thing I can think of, I take off my shirt to show that I'm wearing a binder while very panickly saying "see, I'm not a creepy dude I swear."

Anyway, they all look uncomfortable, end up asking a few more questions before letting me use the locker rooms in peace. I think that's the end of it and I now have a funny story to tell my friends after school.

It was, in fact, not the end.

Turns out a small group of those girls, in their words, "really uncomfortable with a man in the locker rooms, even if he doesn't have a dick and balls." (I'm giggling at kicking my feet at this sentiment) so they all band together and complain to administration about how they are making the locker rooms uncomfortable for everyone by putting me in there.

Administration does not back down, basically saying in fancy terms that I was born a girl so I am girl and I was going to use the girls locker rooms. The group of girls are furious on my behalf, but it gets so much worse when they learn I was using the girl's bathrooms too.

Turns out, there are some girls that don't take gym but do use the bathrooms often, that are also annoyed with my presence. They join up with the girls and continue hounding administration to just let me use the other bathrooms because literally everyone is uncomfortable with my presence. Keep in mind, I have no clue that they are doing this.

Anyway, one girl apparently complains to her mom about this and her mom is furious that the school is sacrificing not only my comfort, but all the girls comfort just to uphold their bigotry. She storms into the school and yells at the principal, threatening to sue.

Well, that's all it took for the principal to get on the intercoms, call me down to the office, slam the gender neutral locker room/ bathroom key in my hand, and say that I was allowed to use whatever bathroom I was comfortable using.

Moral of the story, even if your transphobic, if someone passes well enough, don't try to shove them in with the wrong gender, it just makes everyone uncomfortable
