Jack Daniels is a corporate sponsor of horse torture events- please ask them to stop!

Jack Daniels, the whiskey company, was the major corporate sponsor of the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration this year. This horse show goes for 11 days and includes what are called "big lick" events, where a horse is made to walk with a high step that is caused by pain.

Horse soring is a practice where chemicals like kerosene or diesel fuel are slathered on the horses lower front limbs. Plastic wrap is wrapped around the leg to bake the chemicals in. The horses then have chains placed around their ankles to irritate the inflamed skin. They have these large stacks nailed to their hooves and the stacks sometimes hide tacks that hit the sensitive part of the horses foot. All of this is done to cause pain just so people can cheer as a horse walks with a high front gait. Here is a video that shows what I am talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUNokV5b7pI

The "national celebration" is the Super Bowl for the horse soring crowd. Jack Daniels was a key sponsor this year. They had ads in the program, big inflatable "bottles" of Jack by an entrance and so on.

Please ask Jack Daniels to commit to NEVER sponsoring a Tennessee walking horse event again until horse soring is completely eradicated.

For those wondering, horse soring is illegal in the United States per the Horse Protection Act. But that law is filled with loopholes, including one that allows the horse sorers to hire their own inspectors to see if the horses are sore! Talk about a conflict of interest.

I'm hoping that we can start to do some campaigns like this on our sub. We have the numbers here to stop a lot of cruelty. Lets start with this one. Lets win it and then see what other campaigns we can win!
