§a§
**Status:** Approved.

**Reasoning:**

The post is highly critical and uses provocative language ("ragebait") directed at specific content or a news outlet (Tagesschau). However, Rule 1 explicitly states: **"Criticism is always allowed."**

The post does not violate rules regarding personal attacks, harassment, spam, privacy, or illegal content. While the terminology is strong, it functions as social or political criticism, which is permitted under the forum rules.
