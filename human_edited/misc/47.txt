I am very proud to be Black. To give some examples of what this entails for me, I have a pan-African flag hanging on my damn wall. I read a lot of Black literature, and I value the input of various Black thinkers, even the ones whom I often have disagreements with. Hell, I even only date other Black people, and that's despite me acknowledging that seeking other Black vegans makes my dating pool tiny as shit.

The reason why I'm saying all of this is because I want to put into context the absurdity and unseriousness of how people often react to me being unapologetically vegan. The fact that anyone could even suggest that I am "anti-Black" in any capacity is like saying that Hitler was philosemitic.

By non-vegan leftists who themselves aren't even Black, I have been told multiple times that I must be "self-hating" or a token who is simping for white supremacy simply because I'm not spineless when it comes to refusing to give animal exploitation a pass. I have gotten told that I'm anti-Black for using terms like "animal slavery" as well, even though reflecting on the enslavement of Black people and how much disgust I have for such a horror is something that led me to also reject the enslavement of animals. Of course, I do get people who are actually Black telling me this stuff, too, and that is still very much bothersome.

However, I find this shit to be what is truly anti-Black. Why would my Blackness prevent me from understanding why I should oppose animal exploitation? All anyone needs to do so is basic decency and a sense of justice, but that's the problem: these people do NOT have a sense of justice. They might LARP, virtue signal, and pretend about it, but if it only takes people asking you to grant non-human animals the bare minimum level of basic decency for you to push against that, then you are not as "anti-oppression" as you think you are. On that note, some non-vegan leftists have gone mask-off and said explicitly anti-Black stuff (including slurs) against me. Yikes.

I will always be proud to be Black, and I will always take a stand against animal exploitation. Anyone who sees this as a contradiction can go fuck themself.

**Verdict: Approved**

**Reasoning:**
The post serves as a personal essay/critique regarding the intersection of the user's race and ethical beliefs. While the tone is heated and the subject matter is controversial, it does not violate the specific constraints of the provided rules.

Here is the breakdown against the rules:

*   **Rule 1 (Respect/Inflammatory Remarks):** The user uses strong language ("go fuck themself," "tiny as shit") and aggressive rhetoric. However, the hostility is directed toward a general group outside of the immediate conversation or a hypothetical abstract person ("Anyone who sees this..."), rather than attacking a specific member of the forum. The post falls under "Criticism," which is explicitly allowed.
*   **Rule 3 (Harmful Content/Discrimination):** The user discusses racism and slavery but does so to condemn them ("disgust I have for such a horror"). While the comparison of human slavery to animal agriculture ("animal slavery") is controversial and offensive to some, it is a common philosophical argument in vegan discourse and is used here to explain the user's personal ethical framework, not to demean the history of Black slavery.
*   **Rule 6 (Appropriate Content):** The profanity used is emphatic rather than sexually explicit or graphically disturbing. It fits within the realm of adult social commentary.
*   **Rule 4 (Illegal Content/Swiss Law):** The mention of Hitler is used as a hyperbolic analogy for absurdity ("like saying that Hitler was philosemitic"), not to promote Nazi ideology or deny crimes, which would be illegal under Swiss law.

**Moderator Note:** This thread should be monitored closely. While the OP (Original Poster) is within the rules, the sensitive nature of the comparison between human and animal slavery often triggers heated arguments and rule-breaking behavior in the comment section.
