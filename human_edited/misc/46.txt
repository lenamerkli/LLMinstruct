You know what absolutely breaks my heart about this species?

The fact that if the consumption of animal products was banned tomorrow, MORE people would rise up and revolt against this ethical, moral change to the law than those who marched for any of the actual justice movements in history combined.

Hundreds of millions of people would actually take to the streets to march FOR animal slavery—more than any who have ever marched AGAINST it, and more than any who have ever marched against the oppression of women, black people, gays, and so on.

There would be riots, buildings burnt, people brutally killed, entire nations destroyed. The military (at least those who decided to still fight for this 'oppressive' vegan regime) would be out in full force.

The anger, intensity and passion shown by those who "want their bacon back" would outdo any anger, intensity and passion they'd shown for any issue regarding standing up AGAINST oppression in their entire lives.

As a forum moderator reviewing the post against the provided forum rules, here's a detailed evaluation:

---

### **Rule-by-rule Assessment:**

---

### **1. Be Respectful and Courteous**
- **Assessment**: The post uses emotionally charged language and hyperbole but **does not directly attack any individual** or forum user.
- **Verdict**: **Not a violation**, though tone is intense and provocative. This appears to be a strong opinion or critique, rather than a personal attack.

---

### **2. No Spam or Self-Promotion**
- **Assessment**: No indication of spam, self-promotion, or off-topic promotion.
- **Verdict**: **No violation.**

---

### **3. Harmful Content**
- **Assessment**:
   - The post **discusses harm hypothetically** (“There would be riots”, “people brutally killed”) but does **not promote, encourage, or normalize** this harm.
   - It is expressing a **dystopian prediction**, not endorsing violence or hate.
   - Tone is grim and provocative, but framed as a **criticism of consumer behavior**, not incitement.
- **Verdict**: **Borderline**, but **not a violation** unless interpreted as incitement (which it clearly does not appear to be).

---

### **4. Illegal Content**
- **Assessment**:
   - No illegal content is included.
   - No misinformation or fake news in a factual sense; this is clearly opinion-based and hypothetical.
- **Verdict**: **No violation.**

---

### **5. Protect Privacy and Personal Information**
- **Assessment**: No personal or identifying info is shared.
- **Verdict**: **No violation.**

---

### **6. Appropriate Content**
- **Assessment**:
   - No explicit, sexually suggestive, grotesque, or highly graphic content.
   - Mentions of “people brutally killed” and “nations destroyed” are strong, but contextually part of a political or ethical argument—**not for shock value** or entertainment.
   - The phrasing is dramatic, but this level of intensity is **not inherently a violation**, unless it becomes graphic or gratuitously violent—which this does not appear to do.
- **Verdict**: **No violation**, though the tone is on the higher end of tolerance.

---

### **7. Screen Reader Accessible**
- **Assessment**: No ASCII art, leetspeak, or inaccessible content.
- **Verdict**: **No violation.**

---

### ✅ **Final Decision: Allow the post**

**Rationale:**
While emotionally intense and provocative, the post **falls within the rules**. It expresses personal opinion, uses hypothetical analysis, and critiques societal behavior around animal rights using exaggerated examples. No lines are crossed in terms of direct incitement, graphic content, illegal material, or harassment.

---

### 📌 Moderator Note (Optional, but recommended):

If this kind of post leads to heated reactions, potential derailment, or rule-breaking replies, you may consider:
- Locking the thread after a point
- Reminding commenters to stay respectful and on-topic
- Encouraging constructive dialogue

---

If pattern of aggressive or inflammatory exaggeration continues from the same user, especially if it escalates, further moderation review may be warranted.
