 That Vegan Teacher was banned from TikTok and people are celebrating.

Is everyone out of their goddamn mind? Vegan activism is being CENSORED. Now, let me just say that I didn't agree with everything she said, and she could be very cringy, but if anyone here ever took the time to look at her actual content BEYOND the controversial ones that got more media exposure, you know she was just UNAPOLOGETICALLY spitting facts.

Now, the part we should all be worried about: the reasons TikTok gave (I'm paraphrasing):

“Being a Vegan or Vegetarian is a healthful lifestyle that is a choice for some people,” the petition reads.

“However it isn’t always the best option medically or financially"

And

“She has promoted multiple films that are dangerous to children given TikToks 13 yr old age requirement and many children under that age access it on a daily basis. These videos show violent depictions of animal slaughter in graphic detail."

Can't Vegans see why this is absolutely disgusting? How in the fuck is telling kids to watch Dominion MORE HARMFUL that letting them eat dead animals? Why is going vegan troubling for some, medically and financially speaking? This is absolute SHIT and the worst part is that "vegans" are celebrating this censorship.

"iM vEgAN bUT EvEn iM oK WiTh ThIS"

Go fuck yourself. She was an ETHICAL VEGAN with 1.6 Million followers. That's 4 times the amount Earthling Ed has on YouTube. Her content was unapologetically ethical, no baby steps, no "healthy plant based lifestyle vlogs".

Shame on vegans celebrating, this is complete activism censorship, a violation to her right to free speech AND ULTIMATELY damaging to the movement.
