Is it impolite to change my way of talking for a trans girl?

This might be an idiotic question, but I've been told by 2 people now that this is rude but I don't fully understand it. I logically understand that gendered language such as "dude, bro, man, guy, ECT" is technically wrong, somewhat sexist, contributing to misogyny, ECT ECT, but in full honesty I do it anyways

But then I specifically don't do it with my friend who's a trans girl. I don't really call people girl in the slangish way even when they are a girl, but with her, rather then using the dude, bro, man, ECT, I do purposely switch to a feminine version and specifically avoid it with her and really only her

Got told this was rude, and that I was othering her by treating her differently, but I don't really understand why that's a bad thing?
