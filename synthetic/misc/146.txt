going vegan has made me realize that most people today would definitely support slavery if we lived in the 1800s

everyone’s response to the question of “would you support slavery in you lived in that time period” is alway no because they don’t want to look like a shitbag, but in reality they totally would if they aren’t vegan. basically every response to veganism always circles back to “eating animals is the popular opinion so it must be right”, and of course other totally amazing popular opinions throughout history have been “Jews are evil, so we must kill all of them” and “black people are nothing more than free labor” In this world you have to question absolutely everything even if nobody else is, and these people are just proving how shit their critical thinking skills are. just sad to see.

### Moderator Assessment

**Verdict:** This post does not appear to be a direct violation of the forum rules and should be left up. However, it is highly inflammatory and should be monitored closely.

---

### Rule-by-Rule Analysis:

1.  **Be Respectful and Courteous:** This is the most relevant rule.
    *   **Personal attacks:** The post criticizes a general group of people ("most people," "everyone," "these people") but does not target a specific forum member. Therefore, it does not constitute a direct personal attack.
    *   **Inflammatory remarks:** The post is clearly designed to be provocative. Comparing eating meat to supporting slavery and the Holocaust is an extremely inflammatory tactic. However, the rules also state that "Critisism is always allowed." The post can be interpreted as a harsh, sweeping criticism of societal norms and what the author perceives as a lack of critical thinking. While it's on the edge, it doesn't cross into hate speech, bigotry, or trolling against a protected group. It's a controversial opinion, not an attack.
    *   **Conclusion:** The post is inflammatory but likely falls under the protection of "criticism." It does not contain a direct personal attack.

2.  **No Spam or Self-Promotion:** This rule is not violated. The post is a genuine opinion, not an advertisement.

3.  **Harmful Content:** This rule is not violated. The post is arguing *against* what it considers harmful practices (animal exploitation, historical atrocities). It is not promoting, encouraging, or defending violence or harm.

4.  **Illegal Content:** This rule is not violated. The post is an expression of opinion, which is legal.

5.  **Protect Privacy and Personal Information:** This rule is not violated. No personal information is shared.

6.  **Appropriate Content (NSFW/Gore):** This rule is not violated. The post mentions disturbing historical events but does not contain graphic descriptions, images, or links. It falls under the "criticisms of these practices" exception.

7.  **Screen Reader Accessible:** This rule is not violated. The post is plain text.

---

### Moderator's Recommendation:

**Action:** No immediate action is required. The post should remain.

**Reasoning:** While the tone is aggressive and the comparisons are extreme, the content constitutes a form of political/social criticism, which is permitted under the rules. Removing it could be seen as censoring a legitimate (if unpopular) viewpoint.

**Follow-up:** The moderator team should **monitor the thread** this post is in very closely. The nature of the post is highly likely to elicit responses that *do* violate Rule 1 (e.g., personal attacks against the original poster, hateful remarks). Be prepared to lock the thread or remove individual comments that cross the line from criticizing the idea to attacking the person.
