Explain the following quote from the Great Gatsby: 

‘She's got an indiscreet voice,’ I remarked. ‘It's full of—'
I hesitated.
‘Her voice is full of money,’ he said suddenly.
That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl. . . .

This exchange, from Chapter 7 of *The Great Gatsby*, is one of the novel’s most piercing moments of tragic clarity—an instance where Jay Gatsby, after years of obsessing over Daisy Buchanan and the world she represents, names the unspoken truth that narrator Nick Carraway has been fumbling to articulate. To understand its weight, we must unpack both the immediate tension of the scene and the deeper themes of wealth, identity, and the illusion of the American Dream that it encapsulates.

### The Context: A Lull Before the Storm
The line occurs in the Buchanan estate, in the tense quiet before the climactic argument at the Plaza Hotel. Tom has just begun to confront Gatsby about his affair with Daisy, and the group’s civility is thin. Nick, ever the observant but slightly outsider narrator, comments on Daisy’s voice: he senses it has an "indiscreet" allure—something bold, unapologetic, and impossible to ignore—but cannot pin down why. Gatsby, who has spent over a decade parsing every detail of Daisy’s being (she is, for him, the very embodiment of the status and belonging he has spent his life chasing), cuts through Nick’s hesitation with a single, devastating phrase: *"Her voice is full of money."*

### What "Full of Money" Actually Means
Gatsby’s words are not crass; they are a precise, almost reverent acknowledgment of the core of Daisy’s identity. The phrase does not refer to literal wealth, but to the *essence* of old, inherited East Egg privilege—the kind of wealth that is not flaunted (like Gatsby’s new money, with its gaudy parties and flashy cars) but woven into the bones of a person. For Gatsby, Daisy’s voice carries:
- **Unshakable confidence**: She has never known want, never had to beg for respect, never had to fear the consequences of her words. Her "indiscretion"—the boldness Nick notices—is not recklessness, but the casual impunity of someone born to power. She can speak without caution because her wealth insulates her from accountability.
- **The sound of the unattainable dream**: For Gatsby, the American Dream is not merely wealth—it is the legitimacy and belonging that come with old money. He can earn millions, but he can never replicate the quiet, regal assurance in Daisy’s voice: the sense that she *belongs* to the world of East Egg, that it was made for her. Her voice is that belonging made audible.
- **The illusion of charm**: Nick’s follow-up—*"the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it"*—expands on this: the "jingle" is the trivial sound of money, but the "cymbals' song" is the ceremonial fanfare of generational privilege. It is the allure that Gatsby has spent his life chasing, even as he does not fully recognize that it is an illusion.

### Nick’s Revelation and the Myth of the Golden Girl
Nick’s response—*"That was it. I'd never understood before"*—marks a turning point in his understanding of Daisy and Gatsby’s obsession. His subsequent imagery—*"High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl"*—frames Daisy as a mythic, untouchable figure: exactly how Gatsby has idealized her. But this imagery is laced with irony: the "white palace" evokes purity, but Daisy is far from pure—she is selfish, cowardly, and willing to let Gatsby take the blame for Myrtle Wilson’s death. The "golden girl" is not a real woman; she is a symbol, gilded by Gatsby’s desire, but hollow at the core.

### Thematic Resonance
This moment encapsulates the novel’s central critique of the American Dream. Gatsby believes that if he accumulates enough money, he can win Daisy—and by extension, the status she represents. But Daisy’s voice reveals the unbridgeable gap between new and old money: her privilege is innate, inherited, and impossible to buy. Gatsby’s dream is doomed not because he is poor, but because he mistakes a symbol (Daisy) for a person, and a hollow world of privilege for genuine fulfillment.

In the end, Gatsby’s line is a tragedy: he does not just love Daisy—he loves the version of himself that he thinks being with her will validate. And when he says her voice is full of money, he is acknowledging that the very thing he loves most about her is the thing that makes her irredeemably out of his reach.
