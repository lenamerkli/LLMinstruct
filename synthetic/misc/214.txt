```bash
taskset -c 0-15 chrt -f 50
```
What does this do?
§a§
This command sets CPU affinity and real-time priority for a process. Let me break it down:

## `taskset -c 0-15`
- **Sets CPU affinity** - restricts the process to run only on specific CPU cores
- `-c 0-15` means the process can only use CPU cores 0 through 15 (16 cores total)
- This is useful for:
  - Isolating workloads to specific cores
  - Preventing process migration between cores (reducing cache misses)
  - Dedicated cores for real-time/latency-sensitive tasks

## `chrt -f 50`
- **Sets real-time scheduling policy and priority**
- `-f` uses the **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** scheduling policy
- `50` sets the priority level (0-99, where 99 is highest priority)
- FIFO scheduling means:
  - Process runs until it voluntarily yields or is preempted by higher priority task
  - Higher priority than all normal (SCHED_OTHER) processes
  - Can potentially starve other processes if not carefully managed

## Combined Effect
When you run a command after this (e.g., `taskset -c 0-15 chrt -f 50 ./my_program`), it:
1. Runs your program only on CPU cores 0-15
2. Gives it real-time FIFO scheduling with priority 50

## Common Use Cases
- **High-performance computing**
- **Low-latency applications** (audio processing, trading systems)
- **Real-time systems**
- **Benchmarking** with consistent CPU allocation

⚠️ **Warning**: Using real-time scheduling with high priority requires care, as it can make the system unresponsive if the process doesn't yield appropriately.
