How many animals (including fish and other aquatic animals) are killed by humans per day?
§a§
Between **3.4 and 6.5 billion animals** are killed for food globally every day, with the lower-end estimate translating to approximately 1.2 trillion animals slaughtered annually. This staggering figure becomes even more difficult to comprehend when compared to anthropologists' estimates that only 117 billion human beings have ever existed throughout all of history.

## The Overwhelming Majority Are Aquatic Animals

The vast range in these estimates stems primarily from uncertainty about fish and other aquatic life. Wild-caught fish comprise by far the largest portion of animals killed daily, with estimates ranging between **3 billion and 6 billion** per day. Farmed fish add another **211 million to 339 million** daily deaths. Research by Alison Mood and Phil Brooke estimates that between 1.1 and 2.2 trillion wild finfishes were caught annually during 2000-2019, representing an average of 3.0 to 6.0 billion per day. An additional 78 to 171 billion farmed fishes were slaughtered globally in 2019 alone.

Quantifying fish deaths presents unique challenges because the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) measures fish production by weight rather than individual animals, and their statistics only include farmed fish, not wild-caught species. Researchers must convert total pounds into estimated individual counts, making this an inexact science that produces wide-ranging estimates.

## Land Animals Killed Daily

Among land animals, **chickens dominate** the slaughter statistics with approximately **206 million** killed every day—that's roughly 140,000 per minute. This extraordinary number isn't surprising given that global chicken consumption increased by almost 600 percent between 1961 and 2022, with the average person going from eating 2.86 kg annually to 16.96 kg.

Other land animals slaughtered daily include:
- **Ducks**: 9 million
- **Pigs**: 4 million  
- **Geese**: 2 million
- **Sheep**: 1.7 million
- **Rabbits**: 1.5 million
- **Turkeys**: 1.4 million
- **Goats**: 1.4 million
- **Cows**: 846,000
- **Pigeons and other birds**: 134,000
- **Buffalo**: 77,000
- **Horses**: 13,000

Collectively, approximately 200 million land animals are slaughtered worldwide every single day, totaling 72 billion per year.

## Regional Variations and Trends

The United States alone slaughters roughly 25 million animals every day, with an average slaughterhouse killing up to 1,100 pigs per hour. When accounting for both land and sea animals, more than 55 billion animals die annually to support just the U.S. food supply. This includes adjustments for pre-slaughter mortality, imports, exports, and adds approximately 3.8 billion finned fish and 43.1 billion shellfish killed in 2013.

Global animal slaughter numbers have increased dramatically since the 1960s and continue to rise. In 2023, approximately **85.4 billion land animals** were slaughtered globally, representing a 1.79% increase over 2022—more than double the 0.88% human population growth rate that year. This means the growth rate of animal slaughter continues to outpace population growth, a concerning trend for animal welfare advocates.

## Additional Mortality Beyond Direct Slaughter

These figures don't capture the full scope of animal deaths related to human food systems. Approximately **18 billion animals** per year are killed but never consumed, with their meat wasted at various stages—on farms, during transport, or discarded by grocers. In the U.S., about 25% of these animals die on farms from disease or injury, another 7% die in transit, and 13% are thrown away after processing.

The seafood industry experiences massive **bycatch**, where billions of aquatic animals are accidentally caught and either killed or injured annually. Additionally, around six billion male chicks are intentionally culled each year on factory farms because they cannot lay eggs.

## Welfare Conditions

Around 99% of livestock are raised in factory farms, where efficiency and profitability are prioritized over animal welfare. These animals suffer immensely throughout their short lives, with few laws protecting them from abuse and mistreatment, and violators rarely prosecuted. For fish specifically, 70% of farmed fishes are produced in countries with no animal welfare legislation covering them, and only 0.3% come from countries with fish-specific welfare laws.

The scale of this daily slaughter—billions of sentient beings killed every 24 hours—represents what many consider one of the most significant moral challenges of our time, particularly given that the vast majority of these animals experience considerable suffering throughout their lives and deaths.
