Is Nicolas Guillou still able to use Microsoft Windows?
§a§
**No, Nicolas Guillou is likely unable to use modern Microsoft Windows effectively due to US sanctions.**

As a French judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC) involved in high-profile cases like issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials over the Gaza conflict, Guillou has faced US sanctions. A Borncity report from November 27, 2025, states these sanctions have "catapulted him back to the digital Stone Age of the 1990s," forcing reliance on outdated technology without access to contemporary digital tools or services.

Microsoft, as a US company, complies with such sanctions, blocking updates, cloud services (e.g., OneDrive, Azure), new licenses, or support for sanctioned individuals. This leaves him unable to run or maintain current Windows versions (like Windows 11 25H2, released in late 2025), though he might use very old, unsupported installs from the 90s era (e.g., Windows 95)—but these lack security, internet compatibility, and modern functionality, rendering them impractical today.

No newer reports (as of December 5, 2025) indicate relief from these restrictions.
