What is a conversation that you think other women aren't ready to have?

I believe that eating dairy and eggs is participating in the enslavement of the female reproductive system. It's unfathomably cruel to the female animals and their offspring trapped in that hell, and most women refuse to see it. That mother cow thinks her child is going to the calf that was stolen from her and used as veal, not to a mother's soft wings, their ground up alive as soon as they hatch. It's wrong on so many levels.

**Moderator Review:**

Let's check the post against each rule:

1. **Be Respectful and Courteous**  
   - The post is passionate and strongly worded, but it does not contain personal attacks, harassment, hateful language, bigotry, or trolling.  
   - The criticism is directed at practices (dairy/egg consumption and animal agriculture), not at individuals or groups in a derogatory way.  
   - **Compliant.**

2. **No Spam or Self-Promotion**  
   - No spam, advertisements, or self-promotion present.  
   - **Compliant.**

3. **Harmful Content**  
   - The post discusses animal agriculture and its ethical implications, but does not promote, encourage, or defend violence or harm.  
   - The description of animal suffering is graphic but is used to criticize the practice, not to promote harm.  
   - **Compliant.**

4. **Illegal Content**  
   - No illegal content detected.  
   - **Compliant.**

5. **Protect Privacy and Personal Information**  
   - No personal or identifying information is shared.  
   - **Compliant.**

6. **Appropriate Content (NSFW/Gore)**  
   - The post contains references to animal suffering and practices in the dairy and egg industries, including mention of calves being taken from mothers and chicks being ground up alive.  
   - However, these references are not explicit, sexually suggestive, or graphically detailed beyond what is necessary for criticism.  
   - The rules specifically allow for criticism of these practices "in the right context."  
   - **Compliant, but borderline:** The language is strong, but it is within the context of ethical criticism, which is permitted.

7. **Screen Reader Accessible**  
   - No ASCII art, l33t speak, or inaccessible content.  
   - **Compliant.**

---

**Conclusion:**  
The post is **within the forum rules**. It is a strong ethical criticism of animal agriculture, but does not cross the line into prohibited content. No action is required.

**Optional Moderator Note:**  
If you feel the language may be distressing to some users, you could add a content warning or encourage the user to be mindful of graphic descriptions in future posts, but this is not required by the current rules.
