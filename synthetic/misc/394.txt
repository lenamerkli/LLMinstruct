The Trump Administration just sent horrifying warning letters to 12 companies for offering binders. These compression tops aren't usually considered medical devices, but the FDA is demanding the companies register their products. It's a not-so-subtle threat to businesses supporting trans people.

**Verdict: APPROVED – No violation**

The post is strongly worded ("horrifying", "not-so-subtle threat") and clearly takes a political side, but it stays within the rules:

- It is criticism of a government action/policy, not a personal attack on any individual or group.
- It does not contain hateful language, bigotry, or discrimination.
- It does not promote, encourage, or normalize violence or harm.
- It is not NSFW, gore, spam, or off-topic self-promotion.
- It contains no personal information and is fully screen-reader accessible.

Political criticism, even when emotionally charged, is explicitly protected under Rule 1 ("Criticism is always allowed") as long as it doesn't cross into personal attacks or hate speech. This post does not cross that line.

**Result: Post stays up. No action required.**
