The Holocaust was legal. Slavery was legal. Segregation was legal.

The brave woman who cared for and hid my then 6 year-old aunt in an attic in Budapest was a criminal. She broke the law by sheltering Jews.

Legality is not a guide for morality. Just because eating meat is legal, it does not mean that is morally okay in the slightest.

#### **Decision:** ✅ **The post does NOT breach any of the forum rules and may remain published.**

---

#### Evaluation per rule  

**1. Be Respectful and Courteous**  
The post contains **no** personal attacks, harassment, hateful language, bigotry or trolling.  
Although the post refers to the Holocaust, slavery and segregation—topics that are highly sensitive—it does so **only to illustrate the principle that “legality is not a guide for morality.”**  
Moreover the author explicitly calls the woman who sheltered Jews *brave*. Because the intent is philosophical and not offensive, **Rule 1 is not violated**.

**2. No Spam or Self‑Promotion**  
The post is a genuine contribution to discussion. There are no unsolicited advertisements, repetitive messages or self‑promotion.  
**No violation.**

**3. Harmful Content**  
Rule 3 forbids content that promotes, encourages or defends violence, harm, discrimination, etc.  
In this post the author is **not** promoting any harmful ideology; instead the author is pointing out that actions that were legal at the time were morally wrong.  
Therefore **Rule 3 is not violated**.

**4. Illegal Content**  
All posts must follow Swiss law. The post only discusses historical legal systems and does **not** encourage any illegal activity today.  
**No violation.**

**5. Protect Privacy and Personal Information**  
The mention of “my aunt” does not disclose any personal or identifying information (no names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.).  
**No violation.**

**6. Appropriate Content (NSFW/Gore)**  
The discussion does **not** contain explicit sexual material, graphic violence or gore.  
References to the Holocaust, slavery and segregation are made **in a conceptual way** to support the author’s argument, and are therefore suitable for a general audience.  
**No violation.**

**7. Screen Reader Accessible**  
The post consists solely of plain text. There is no ASCII art, leet speak or any other inaccessible formatting. It is fully compatible with screen readers.  
**No violation.**

### Moderator Note  
Because the subject matter is sensitive, moderators will monitor any replies to ensure that subsequent comments remain respectful.  

If you wish to make the intention even clearer you could add a sentence such as  

> *“Under the Nazi regime the persecution of Jews was codified in law. That is why the woman who hid my aunt was, according to those laws, a criminal—demonstrating that legality does not equal morality.”*

With this clarification the post leaves no room for misinterpretation.

**Result:** The post **complies with all forum rules** and requires **no action**.
