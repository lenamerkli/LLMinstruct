The Holocaust was legal. Slavery was legal. Segregation was legal.

The brave woman who cared for and hid my then 6 year-old aunt in an attic in Budapest was a criminal. She broke the law by sheltering Jews.

Legality is not a guide for morality. Just because eating meat is legal, it does not mean that is morally okay in the slightest.

### **Rule Compliance Check**
1. **Be Respectful and Courteous**  
   - ✅ **Compliant.** The post does not contain personal attacks, harassment, or hateful language. It presents a historical and moral argument respectfully.  
   - *Note:* While the topic is sensitive, the tone is analytical, not inflammatory.

2. **No Spam or Self-Promotion**  
   - ✅ **Compliant.** The post is a substantive discussion, not spam or self-promotion.

3. **Harmful Content**  
   - ✅ **Compliant.** The post does not *promote, encourage, or defend* violence or harm. It references historical atrocities (Holocaust, slavery, segregation) to make a moral argument, not to glorify them. The example of the woman hiding a Jewish child is framed as *moral courage*, not harm.

4. **Illegal Content**  
   - ✅ **Compliant.** The post discusses historical events and moral philosophy. It does not violate Swiss law.

5. **Protect Privacy and Personal Information**  
   - ✅ **Compliant.** The aunt and the woman are referenced in a historical context. No private details (e.g., full names, addresses) are shared. The aunt’s age (6 years old) and location (Budapest) are historical facts, not private information.

6. **Appropriate Content (NSFW/Gore)**  
   - ✅ **Compliant.** The post mentions the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation but does not include explicit, graphic, or disturbing details. It focuses on the *moral contradiction* between legality and ethics.  
   - *Note:* The reference to the Holocaust is historical and educational, not sensationalized.

7. **Screen Reader Accessible**  
   - ✅ **Compliant.** The post uses plain text, no ASCII art, l33t speak, or inaccessible formatting.

### **Moderation Decision**
✅ **ALLOW the post.**  

#### **Reasoning**  
- The post engages in a **legitimate ethical discussion** about the difference between legality and morality, using historical examples to illustrate its point.  
- It does not violate any rules:  
  - It is respectful and fact-based.  
  - It does not promote harm, hate, or illegal activities.  
  - It handles sensitive topics (e.g., the Holocaust) with contextual purpose, not gratuitousness.  
- The inclusion of the personal anecdote (the aunt and the woman in Budapest) adds emotional weight to the argument without compromising privacy.  

#### **Recommendation**  
- If the forum has a "Sensitive Topics" label or warning system, consider applying it to this post to prepare readers for the historical subject matter.  
- Encourage constructive discussion by asking users to focus on the ethical argument rather than debating the historical facts (which are well-documented).  

**Final Action:** Post remains visible. No action needed beyond standard monitoring.
