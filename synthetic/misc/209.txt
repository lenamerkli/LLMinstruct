My ethics class is so anti-animal it makes me depressed 



I have to take a “natural resource” ethics class for my biology degree and while I hoped the class would be a genuine place to dissect different viewpoints, it’s in actuality just a class to justify killing animals and any opposing viewpoints are subtly ridiculed.

Like when discussing the ethics of killing animals in certain contexts, they’ll give a million reasons for it and when they give a few loose reasons against it like “some people don’t like when animals are killed” then a big part of the class starts snickering.

The class snickers or starts outright laughing and getting amped up angry WHENEVER anti-lethal animal treatment is brought up. In food, wildlife management, anything. And the only source they ever site to give justification for our viewpoint is PETA. Which as you all know, does not inspire good faith discussion in any way.

The professor also puts on a funny voice whenever he reads quotes from people who were pro-animals-being-considered, though I don’t think he even notices he does it.

They were talking about trap-neuter-release programs today as opposed to killing feral cat populations and the hunters in the class made their opinion very known and the professor never tells THEM to be respectful of other viewpoints, but the professor gave a speech to any vegans in the class that they need to be respectful of those that disagree.

In contrast I have taken an environmental ethics class that presented the “vegan” arguments very well and got a lot of people to think twice about how they thought animals should be treated. This class has barely presented a single vegan argument, so naturally now the whole class has believed that there are no solid arguments on the other side. The professor said that there are a “few” vegans in the class but i don’t know any others because we’ve all been too scared to stand up and defend our beliefs in this class environment. And it’s not that im against talking about the ethics of certain measures for dealing with overpopulation/invasive species, but the arguments are so tainted against considering animals to be worthy of consideration that it’s not a fair discussion and the only opinion that gets support is “kill all problem animals”

I just needed to rant to people who get it because I’m feeling that existential depression that comes with feeling completely hopeless in trying to make the world a better place for animals. Like you’re the only person in the world who feels the way you do.

**Moderation Decision: Approved**

This post does not violate any forum rules.

The user is sharing a personal experience and expressing frustration about perceived bias in an academic setting. While the post discusses animal ethics and references topics like killing feral cats or wildlife management, it does so in a critical and academic context—not to promote or defend harm, but to critique what the user sees as an unfair classroom environment.

Key points:
- **Rule 1**: The post criticizes a class structure and professor's approach but does not personally attack, harass, or use hateful language toward individuals. Criticism is explicitly allowed.
- **Rule 3**: The user is *opposing* what they perceive as normalization of harm toward animals, not promoting it.
- **Rule 6**: Discussion of animal ethics in this context is appropriate and not graphic.

The post is a respectful vent from someone feeling marginalized for their ethical beliefs. No action required.
