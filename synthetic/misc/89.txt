憲保護者 與 國權威，
為祖國山河千秋發揚，
傳承傳統愛民煌。

法律嚴明民心頌,
誠信至上的Policy,
永遠捍衛家園利益，
強大民族精神如鷹飛。

What does this mean.
§a§
First, there’s a **likely typo** in the first line:
The term *憲保護者* should be **憲法保護者** (Xiànfǎ Bǎohùzhě = *Constitution Guardians*). "憲" alone is an abbreviation for "constitution," but "guardian" requires the full word *憲法* to make sense.


### What the text means (it’s a formal, rhyming patriotic slogan):
The text uses Traditional Chinese and slogan-style phrasing (common in formal patriotic contexts). Below is a line-by-line translation and overall breakdown:

| Original Line | Natural English Translation (preserving slogan tone) |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 憲法保護者 與 國權威， | *Constitution Guardians and national authority* |
| 為祖國山河千秋發揚， | *Strive to perpetuate the motherland’s rivers and mountains for thousands of years* |
| 傳承傳統愛民煌。 | *Pass down the glory of the traditional value of "loving the people"* <br>(Note: Slogan shorthand—full grammar would be *傳承愛民傳統之煌*) |
| 法律嚴明民心頌, | *Strict, clear laws are praised by the people* |
| 誠信至上的Policy, | *An "integrity first" policy* <br>(Note: *Policy* is written in English here, an unusual but literal choice) |
| 永遠捍衛家園利益， | *Forever defend the interests of our homeland* |
| 強大民族精神如鷹飛。 | *The great national spirit soars like an eagle* |


### Overall Theme:
This slogan emphasizes core patriotic values (for a region using Traditional Chinese):
- Respect for the constitution, national authority, and the rule of law
- Preserving the motherland’s territory and traditional "people-centered" values
- Upholding integrity as a key guiding principle
- Celebrating the nation’s strong, soaring spirit (symbolized by an eagle)
