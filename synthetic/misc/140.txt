§a§
**Action:** **Allow the Post.**

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Rule 1 (Respectful and Courteous):** The post is highly critical of a public figure's business practices and perceived contradictions, using provocative language ("animal corpses"). However, it does not constitute a personal attack, harassment, hate speech, or bigotry directed at an individual member. The rules explicitly state: **"Criticism is always allowed."**
2.  **Rule 6 (Appropriate Content):** While the language ("animal corpses") is graphic, it is used in the context of criticizing commercial practices (selling meat products) rather than posting gratuitous, excessive, or graphically disturbing material for shock value. This falls under the allowance for critical discussion.
3.  **Other Rules:** The post does not violate rules regarding spam, illegal content, privacy, or accessibility.
