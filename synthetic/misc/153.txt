 Two days ago I shared veggie sandwiches with an unhoused person. Just now offered them a bagel with vegan cream cheese. The following ensued..

Me: morning! How are you doing?

Them: I’m good. How are you?

Me: I’m good, thanks. Wanted to offer you bagel with vegan cream cheese

Them: Oh, I can’t do the vegan thing

Me: you can’t eat plants?

Them: well, like lettuce is okay

Me: Well, you enjoyed those sandwiches you enjoyed the other day

Them: I didn’t recognize you!! They were so good!!!

Me: no worries! I’m glad you liked the sandwiches and thought you may appreciate a bagel. It was vegan mayo (vegansise) and vegan cheese on those sandwiches

Them: oh really??!?

Me: ya…. You sure you don’t wanna try the bagel and cream cheese?

Them: no, thank you

Me: okay.. well, have a nice day….

I can’t fucking understand our species and hate myself for continuing to try. Anyways, happy Friday to my fellow vegans 💜

Do homeless people actually do not want plants?
§a§
First, it’s worth taking a step back and remembering that the person you talked to is just that—**one individual** with his own tastes, habits, and circumstances.  Their “I can’t do the vegan thing” response doesn’t tell us anything about all people who are experiencing homelessness, and it certainly isn’t a species‑wide rule.  

Below are some of the most common reasons why someone who is unhoused might decline a plant‑based offering, followed by a few practical tips if you want to keep sharing food in a way that feels respectful to both you and the people you’re helping.

## Why a person experiencing homelessness might say “no” to vegan food

| Category | Typical factors | How it can look in a conversation |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Taste & familiarity** | • Many people grow up eating meat, dairy, or processed foods and may not have a reference point for “just lettuce.” <br>• Some plant‑based products (vegan cheese, mayo, etc.) have textures or flavors that feel “different” or “artificial” to someone who isn’t used to them. | “I’m not used to that taste,” or “I don’t know what it is.” |
| **Calorie density & satiety** | • When you’re hungry, you often crave foods that feel *heavier* and keep you full longer (e.g., peanut butter, cheese, meat). <br>• Fresh produce can be perceived as “light” and may not satisfy a big appetite. | “I need something that will keep me full.” |
| **Nutritional concerns** | • Some people have medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, anemia) that make them wary of certain plant foods. <br>• Others may have limited knowledge about how to get enough protein or calories from a vegan diet. | “I’m not sure if that will give me enough protein.” |
| **Access & habit** | • Many shelters, soup kitchens, and food pantries primarily serve meat‑based or dairy‑based meals. <br>• If you’ve been getting food a certain way for weeks, a sudden change can feel risky. | “I’m used to the meals they give me.” |
| **Psychological & emotional factors** | • Food can be a source of comfort; people may cling to familiar flavors when life feels unstable. <br>• Some may associate “vegan” with a lifestyle they don’t identify with, even if they would eat the same foods. | “I don’t feel like trying something new right now.” |
| **Practical logistics** | • Vegan items sometimes require refrigeration (e.g., cream cheese) that isn’t available on the street. <br>• If the food is packaged in a way that’s hard to eat on the go, it’s less appealing. | “I can’t keep this fresh.” |
| **Simple miscommunication** | • “I can’t do the vegan thing” could just be a quick way of saying “I’m not hungry for that right now,” not a philosophical stance. | “I’m not really in the mood.” |

> **Bottom line:** The refusal is usually about *personal need or preference at that moment*, not a blanket rejection of plants.

## How to approach offering food in the future

1. **Ask first, then offer**  
   - *Example*: “Hey, I have a bagel with vegan cream cheese and a peanut‑butter sandwich. Anything sound good to you?”  
   - This gives the person agency to pick what they want, rather than feeling pressured to accept a specific item.

2. **Keep it simple and familiar**  
   - Items that are already known to be tasty and filling (e.g., peanut butter, hummus, fruit, granola bars) often get a better reception.  
   - If you want to stay vegan, you can still choose “comfort” foods: a hearty bean chili, a nut‑butter sandwich, a banana with almond butter, etc.

3. **Provide a brief, non‑judgmental description**  
   - “It’s a bagel with a spread made from almonds—kind of like cream cheese but dairy‑free.”  
   - This helps demystify the food without sounding like a sales pitch.

4. **Be ready to accept a “no” graciously**  
   - A simple “No problem, have a great day!” keeps the interaction positive and leaves the door open for future offers.

5. **Consider a mixed approach**  
   - If you have the resources, bring a small variety: one vegan item, one non‑vegan (if you’re comfortable), and maybe a fruit or snack bar. That way the person can choose what feels right for them.

6. **Think about nutrition, not just ideology**  
   - The ultimate goal for many people experiencing homelessness is *calorie and nutrient intake*. If a vegan option meets those needs, great—but if it’s low‑calorie or hard to eat on the street, it may not be the most helpful choice at that moment.

## What research and anecdotal evidence say

- **Surveys of shelter clients** (e.g., studies from the National Alliance to End Homelessness) consistently show that *taste, familiarity, and satiety* rank higher than dietary philosophy when people choose meals.
- **Food‑bank data** indicates that fresh produce is often the *least* requested item, not because people dislike vegetables, but because they’re looking for “heavy” foods that keep them full longer.
- **Qualitative interviews** with unhoused individuals frequently mention that *access to refrigeration* and *ease of consumption* are decisive factors. A bagel with a spread that can melt or spoil quickly may be less appealing than a sturdy granola bar.

These findings reinforce the idea that the “vegan thing” is rarely a moral objection; it’s usually a practical one.

## A compassionate perspective for yourself

It’s natural to feel frustrated when you’re trying to share something you care about and it’s turned down. But remember:

- **Your intention matters** – You’re offering kindness and food, which is valuable regardless of the exact menu.
- **Self‑compassion is key** – You’re not “failing” because someone said no. You’re learning how to meet people where they are.
- **Small wins add up** – Even if the bagel was declined, the conversation may have built a tiny bit of trust. That could lead to future exchanges where the person feels comfortable trying something new.

### TL;DR

- **No, homeless people as a group do not “not want plants.”** The refusal you experienced was likely about personal taste, hunger level, familiarity, or practicality—not a universal aversion to vegan food.
- **If you want to keep sharing food**, ask what they’d like, keep options simple and filling, and be ready to accept a polite “no.”
- **Your kindness still matters**—the act of offering is a positive gesture, even if the specific item isn’t accepted.

Feel free to keep reaching out, stay open to feedback, and remember that every interaction is a chance to learn more about the diverse needs and preferences of the people you’re trying to help. 💜
