There is a special place in hell for people who throw away animals in the trash.

Here are a few options for a provocative comment, depending on what kind of reaction you want to provoke (moral hypocrisy, cynicism, or philosophical debate):

**Option 1: The "Speciesism" Angle (Likely to start a huge argument)**
"It is fascinating to watch people wish eternal damnation on someone for this, while simultaneously paying the meat industry to torture and slaughter animals just as smart as cats every single day for lunch. Your morality is purely aesthetic."

**Option 2: The "Human Suffering" Angle (The 'Whataboutism' approach)**
"If only people could muster up 10% of this outrage for the actual human beings dying in the streets and war zones right now. It’s easier to cry over a cat than face real human tragedy."

**Option 3: The Cynical/Nihilistic Angle**
"Hell is just a fairy tale we tell ourselves to feel better because we know the justice system won't actually do anything about it. The reality is that cruelty usually goes unpunished."

**Option 4: The Technical/Legal Angle**
"Technically, under the law, animals are just property—no different than a toaster. Until we change the laws to give them personhood, throwing them away is logically consistent with how the system views them."
