Is ICE discriminating against LGBT people?
§a§
Based on the available evidence, there are substantial documented allegations and findings that ICE has discriminated against and mistreated LGBT people in its custody.

## Documented Abuse and Discrimination

Multiple reports and civil rights complaints detail systemic mistreatment of LGBT detainees. A 2024 survey of 41 LGBTQ and HIV-positive immigrants in ICE custody found that approximately one-third reported sexual abuse, physical assaults, or sexual harassment due to their LGBTQ identity, and nearly all (35 out of 41) reported being targets of homophobic, transphobic, or other verbal abuse . Research has found that LGBTQ people in ICE custody are 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than the general population .

## Medical Neglect and Denial of Care

LGBT detainees have reported systematic denial of necessary medical care. The majority of HIV-positive survey participants (13 out of 17) reported being denied HIV treatment or other medical care while in custody . Transgender detainees have been denied access to hormone replacement therapy and gender-affirming care, and many have been subjected to prolonged solitary confinement .

## Recent Policy Changes

The Trump administration has taken steps that advocates argue worsen conditions for transgender immigrants. ICE removed its 2015 "Transgender Care Memorandum" from its website and amended detention facility contracts to remove transgender care requirements . Additionally, ICE began excluding congressionally mandated data on transgender people from its public detention reports starting in February 2025, limiting transparency and oversight .

## Specific Facility Complaints

Civil rights complaints filed in 2025 detail abuse at specific facilities. At the Aurora Contract Detention Facility in Colorado, transgender and nonbinary detainees reported being locked in their dorms for at least 23 hours daily, medical neglect, and dehumanizing treatment . Similar complaints were filed regarding the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, documenting sexual assault, harassment, and denial of medical care .

Human rights organizations and advocates have called for ending the detention of transgender and nonbinary people in ICE custody, arguing the agency cannot ensure their safety .
