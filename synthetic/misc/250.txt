Has ICE become Trumps secret police?
§a§


During President Trump's second administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has undergone significant operational transformations that have prompted national security officials, legal experts, and civil rights organizations to characterize it as an "unfettered and unaccountable national police force" operating in "near-total anonymity on the orders of the president". These changes represent what current and former officials describe as "the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world's most repressive regimes".

## Operational Changes and Tactics

ICE agents now routinely conduct operations while wearing masks and operating without visible identification. Officers no longer wear shoulder insignia or name tags, making individual accountability nearly impossible. This practice has spread across major American cities, with masked agents conducting arrests in parking lots, outside daycare centers, and in residential hallways. The agency has conducted sweeping nationwide raids, with at least 9,000 people arrested in California alone by June 2025, followed by major operations in Portland (560 arrests in October), Chicago (3,000 detained in Operation Midway Blitz), and Charlotte (250 arrests).

The scale of detention has reached unprecedented levels. As of late November 2025, at least 60,000 people were in detention—the highest number ever recorded—representing a massive increase from 39,000 at the end of 2024. Federal court records from the Chicago operation reveal that 97% of those detained did not have a criminal record.

## Dismantling of Oversight

The transformation involved the systematic elimination of accountability mechanisms. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), created by Congress to investigate allegations of rape, unlawful searches, and other violations, has been effectively gutted. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, describing CRCL as functioning "as internal adversaries that slow down operations". The office had previously been effective in stalling rushed deportations and ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers.

Trump also eliminated the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which flagged inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities. While the office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, it remains sparsely staffed.

## Resource Expansion

While other federal agencies face devastating cuts and overbroad layoffs, ICE has received unprecedented funding. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," signed into law on July 4, 2025, provided $170.1 billion in new spending for immigration enforcement, making ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in history—funded at a level higher than some foreign militaries. An additional $7.5 billion annually for the next four years was allocated specifically for recruiting and retention.

As part of its hiring blitz, ICE has dropped age, training, and education standards, offering recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000. Agents from at least five federal agencies outside ICE have been reassigned to immigration enforcement duties.

## Expert Analysis and Concerns

Political scientists and legal scholars have expressed alarm at these developments. Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism, pointed to the "daylight snatching of the Tufts student" as evidence of ICE functioning as a secret police force. David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor researching policing and democracy, emphasized that "it's not just that people can't see faces of the officers. The officers aren't wearing shoulder insignia or name tags".

A federal judge in Florida, a Republican appointee, issued a blistering ruling stating that "masks are the domain of sort of scoundrels and the Ku Klux Klan and that has no place in our state and our policing". Even internal concerns have emerged: an FBI bulletin expressed worries about the erosion of public trust due to masking practices, despite public administration officials defending the policy.

## Constitutional and Legal Issues

The operations raise multiple constitutional concerns. ICE agents have engaged in unnecessary secrecy and subterfuge to seize immigrants off the street, potentially violating Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure. The Fifth Amendment guarantee that no person can be "deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law" is challenged by practices such as sending hundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador's CECOT prison "based on secret, flimsy, and unchallengeable allegations".

The rescission of policies limiting ICE enforcement at churches and schools has spread worry that "no place is safe". High-profile instances include the detention of elected officials: New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.

## Administration Defense

The Department of Homeland Security has strongly refuted characterizations of ICE as a secret police force. DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called such comparisons "smears and demonization" that led to an attack on an ICE facility in Texas where a gunman shot three detained migrants, killing two. An ICE spokesperson stated that "ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism," arguing that critics are "simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence".

Homeland Security defends masking as necessary due to a sharp rise in attacks on agents and facilities, pointing to documented incidents of violence against ICE personnel and facilities.

## Broader Implications

The transformation represents a reversal of accountability measures implemented after George Floyd's murder in 2020, which had pushed for greater transparency and police oversight. The administration has also ended most consent decree relationships that addressed civil rights violations in police departments nationwide.

Civil rights advocates warn of expanding enforcement beyond immigrants. Michelle Brané stated: "ICE, their secret police, is their tool. Once they have that power, which they have now, there's nothing stopping them from using it against citizens". The combination of masked agents, eliminated oversight, unprecedented funding, and lowered hiring standards has created what officials describe as a fundamental shift in American law enforcement that extends beyond immigration policy into questions about democratic accountability and the rule of law.
