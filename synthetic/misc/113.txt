I'm in Minecraft and want to make a 45° turn to the right with a radius of 100 blocks. Where will I end up when I am at -4412,Y,-96 and facing east?
§a§
Let me solve this step by step.

1. Starting position: (-4412, Y, -96)
2. Facing: East (positive X direction)
3. Turn: 45° right (so final direction will be southeast)
4. Radius: 100 blocks

For a 45° turn, we need to:
- Move forward (east) by radius × sin(45°)
- Move sideways (south) by radius × (1 - cos(45°))

Since sin(45°) = cos(45°) = √2/2 ≈ 0.707:
- X distance = 100 × 0.707 ≈ 71 blocks
- Z distance = 100 × 0.707 ≈ 71 blocks

Starting from (-4412, Y, -96):
- New X = -4412 + 71 = -4341
- New Z = -96 + 71 = -25

Final position: (-4341, Y, -25)
Final direction: Southeast

First of all, east is positive X (and south positive Z). Second of all: The final location you are describing is for a 90° turn with a radius of 71.

I apologize for my confusion. You're absolutely right - let me solve this correctly.

For a 45° turn with radius 100 blocks, starting at (-4412, Y, -96) facing east (positive X):

1. The turn will be part of a circle. For a 45° turn:
- The distance along X will be: R × sin(45°) = 100 × 0.707 ≈ 71 blocks
- The distance along Z will be: R × (1 - cos(45°)) = 100 × (1 - 0.707) ≈ 29 blocks

Therefore:
- New X = -4412 + 71 = -4341
- New Z = -96 + 29 = -67

Final position: (-4341, Y, -67)
Final direction: Southeast (45° from east)

This time the math correctly reflects a 45° turn with a 100-block radius. Thank you for the correction!
