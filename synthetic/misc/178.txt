What does o7 mean?
§a§
**o7** is an old-school text emoticon that represents a little stick figure giving a military-style salute.

Breakdown  
• **o** → the head  
• **7** → the arm and hand raised to the forehead in salute  

Meaning & usage  
1. “Respect!” / “Salute!” – Acknowledging someone’s achievement or sacrifice.  
2. Farewell – “Goodbye, fly safe o7.”  
3. Solidarity – Showing you’re on the same team or share the same sentiment.

Where you’ll see it  
• Gaming communities (EVE Online, Star Citizen, Twitch chat, Discord, Reddit).  
• Tech forums and meme culture when people want to pay their respects without spamming GIFs or emojis.

Example sentences  
• “That clutch play was amazing, o7.”  
• “Servers are shutting down tonight. Thanks for the memories, o7.”  
• “To all the devs who fixed the bug so fast, o7.”

Alternatives  
o/  – waving hello  
/7   – salute facing the other way  
07   – same idea without the “head”

That’s all there is to it—just a quick, ASCII way to tip your hat (or helmet) online!
