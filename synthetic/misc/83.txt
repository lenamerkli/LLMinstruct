Rewrite this sentence.
§a§
Here are several clear, professional rewrites of the sentence, depending on the nuance you want to convey. **The key issue in the original is the awkward repetition of "range" and "error," which creates confusion.** Standard phrasing uses **"margin of error"** (not "range of error") in scientific/technical contexts:

### Concise & Clear Options:
1. **"The decrease may fall within the margin of error."**
   *(Most natural for statistics/science; removes redundancy and uses standard terminology.)*
2. **"Depending on the error margin, this decrease could be due to measurement error."**
   *(Clarifies causality and replaces "range of error" with precise terms.)*
3. **"This reduction may not be significant, as it lies within the margin of error."**
   *(Emphasizes statistical insignificance, common in research writing.)*

### If Emphasizing Uncertainty:
4. **"Given the error margin, the observed decrease might reflect measurement uncertainty rather than a true change."**
   *(Explicitly distinguishes between real effect and error; ideal for technical reports.)*

### Why these work better:
- ✅ **"Margin of error"** is the standard term (not "range of error").
- ✅ Eliminates the confusing repetition of "range" and "error."
- ✅ Clarifies whether the decrease is *caused by* error or *statistically indistinguishable* from error.
- ✅ Uses active verbs ("fall," "lies," "reflect") for precision.

### Avoid This Phrasing:
> ❌ *"Depending on the error range, this decrease may be in the range of error."*
> **Why:** The phrase "range of error" is non-idiomatic, and repeating "range/error" makes it sound circular and vague.

### Recommendation:
- For **scientific/technical writing**, use **#1 or #3**.
- For **general audiences**, use **#2**.
- If you can specify *what decreased* (e.g., "temperature," "sales"), add it:
  > *"The decline in sales may fall within the margin of error."*
