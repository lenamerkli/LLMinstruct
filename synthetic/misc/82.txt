How can I make that \include does not create a page break before and after?
§a§
To prevent the `\include` command from adding page breaks before and after the included file, you have a few options:

### **Option 1: Use `\input` Instead of `\include`**
The `\include` command is designed to always start a new page before and after the included content. Instead, use `\input`, which does not add page breaks:

```latex
\section{Replication}

    \subsection{Without Code Changes}
        \input{replication_without.tex}

    \subsection{With Code Changes}
```

### **Option 2: Redefine `\include` to Behave Like `\input` (Not Recommended)**
If you must use `\include` (e.g., for `\includeonly` functionality), you can redefine it to remove the page breaks:

```latex
\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\include}[1]{%
    \@input@{#1.tex}%
}
\makeatother
```

However, this may interfere with other functionalities (like `\includeonly`), so **`\input` is the better choice** in most cases.

### **Option 3: Use `newclude` Package (Alternative)**
The `newclude` package provides a modified version of `\include` that allows more control:

```latex
\usepackage{newclude}
...
\subsection{Without Code Changes}
    \include*{replication_without}  % No page breaks
```

### **Best Practice**
- **Use `\input`** if you just need to insert content without page breaks.
- **Use `\include`** only if you need its special features (like selective compilation with `\includeonly`), but be aware of the forced page breaks.

Would you like help adjusting the content of `replication_without.tex` to fit better in the flow?
