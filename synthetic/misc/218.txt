How can I randomly sort the output?
§a§

Of course! To randomly sort the output of your query, you can add an `ORDER BY` clause with a random function.

The exact function name varies depending on the SQL database you are using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

### The General Idea

You will add `ORDER BY` and a function that generates a random number for each row. The database then sorts the rows based on these random numbers.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY -- your random function goes here --
```

### Solutions for Different SQL Databases

Here is the specific syntax for the most common database systems.

#### 1. MySQL, MariaDB, or SQLite

Use the `RAND()` function (or `RANDOM()` in SQLite).

```sql
-- For MySQL / MariaDB
SELECT *
FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY RAND();
```

```sql
-- For SQLite
SELECT *
FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY RANDOM();
```

**How it works:** `RAND()` generates a random floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0 for each row. The `ORDER BY` clause then sorts the rows based on these values, resulting in a random order.

#### 2. PostgreSQL

Use the `RANDOM()` function.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY RANDOM();
```
**How it works:** Similar to MySQL, `RANDOM()` generates a random number (a double precision value) for each row, which is then used for sorting.

#### 3. SQL Server

The best practice in SQL Server is to use `NEWID()`. **Do not use `RAND()`**, as it is evaluated only once per query, giving every row the same random value and resulting in no random sorting.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY NEWID();
```

**How it works:** `NEWID()` creates a new Unique Identifier (GUID) for each row. Since GUIDs are designed to be unique, they are effectively random for sorting purposes.

#### 4. Oracle

Use the `DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE` function.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE;
```

**How it works:** This function from the `DBMS_RANDOM` package generates a random number for each row, which is then used to sort the result set.

### Important Considerations

#### ⚠️ Performance Warning

Random sorting is **very slow on large tables**. The database must:
1.  Generate a random value for **every single row** that matches your `WHERE` clause.
2.  Perform a full sort on the entire result set.

This operation cannot use standard indexes, so for tables with millions of rows, it can cause a significant performance hit.

#### 🔄 Reproducible Random Order (for Testing)

If you need to get the *same* random order every time you run the query (useful for testing or debugging), you can provide a "seed" to the random function. Using the same seed will produce the same sequence of random numbers.

```sql
-- Example for MySQL
-- This query will always return the rows in the same "random" order.
SELECT *
FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY RAND(12345); -- 12345 is the seed
```
Note: Not all database systems support a seed in their random function (e.g., PostgreSQL's `RANDOM()` does not).

#### 🎲 Alternative: Getting a Random Sample

If your goal isn't to see all rows in a random order, but rather to get a **random sample** of rows, there are more efficient methods.

For example, in PostgreSQL you can use `TABLESAMPLE`:

```sql
-- Gets approximately 10% of the table's rows, efficiently
SELECT *
FROM train TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM(10)
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%';
```
This is much faster than `ORDER BY RANDOM()` because it reads random data pages from the disk instead of sorting the entire table. However, it's for sampling, not for ordering the full result set.
