Sexual abuse is not okay, not even done to other species. How do you explain this to non-vegans?
§a§
**Common ground approach:**
Most non-vegans already agree that sexual abuse of animals is wrong. You can explore *why* they hold that view:
- Animals can't meaningfully consent
- It causes suffering/harm
- It exploits a vulnerable being for human gratification

**The consistency question:**
Some vegans then ask: "If those reasons matter here, why don't they apply to other animal uses?" This can open genuine dialogue.

**Potential responses you might encounter:**
- "Necessity" - some see food as necessary, sexual abuse as gratuitous
- "Naturalness" - eating animals occurs in nature; sexual abuse doesn't
- "Degree of harm" - some distinguish types/severity of harm
- "Social convention" - different practices carry different moral weight culturally

**My honest observation:**
This argument works best as a conversation-opener about moral consistency, not as a "gotcha." People generally respond poorly to comparisons that feel like rhetorical traps, even if there's logical merit.

The strongest approach is usually genuine curiosity: "What makes one wrong but not the other, in your view?" - then actually listening to their reasoning.

What context are you thinking about this in? That might help me offer more specific thoughts.
