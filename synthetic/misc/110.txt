What happened on June 4th, 1989 in Poland?
§a§

June 4th, 1989, marks one of the most pivotal dates in modern Polish history and the end of the Cold War in Europe. On this day, **Poland held its first semi-free parliamentary elections** since the end of World War II, resulting in a landslide victory for the anti-communist **Solidarity movement** and effectively ending decades of communist rule.

Here's what happened and why it was so significant:

1.  **The Context:**
    *   Poland had been under communist rule since 1945, heavily influenced by the Soviet Union.
    *   The **Solidarity movement**, led by Lech Wałęsa, emerged in 1980 as a massive, independent trade union and broad-based social movement demanding political and economic reform. It was banned in 1981 after the government imposed martial law.
    *   By the late 1980s, the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) was facing severe economic crisis, widespread public discontent, and pressure from the reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev (who signaled the USSR would no longer use force to prop up satellite regimes).

2.  **The "Semi-Free" Elections:**
    *   Negotiations between the communist government and Solidarity (represented by the "Round Table Talks" in early 1989) resulted in a compromise electoral law.
    *   Crucially, the agreement reserved **65% of the seats in the Sejm (lower house)** for the communists and their satellite parties (the "Coalition of the Democratic Left"). Only **35% were contested in relatively free elections**.
    *   **The Senate (upper house)** was entirely up for grabs in free elections.
    *   Crucially, the agreement also allowed **Solidarity to participate openly** for the first time since 1981.

3.  **The Election Results (June 4th & 18th):**
    *   **June 4th:** Voting took place for the contested Sejm seats and all Senate seats.
    *   **Overwhelming Solidarity Victory:** Despite only competing for 35% of the Sejm seats, Solidarity candidates won **99% of the contested seats** (160 out of 161 contested seats). In the Senate, Solidarity won **92 out of 100 seats**.
    *   **Communist Defeat:** The communists and their allies won almost none of the contested seats, exposing their lack of popular support. They only maintained power through the guaranteed 65% block.

4.  **The Significance and Aftermath:**
    *   **End of Communist Dominance:** The results shattered the communist party's claim to legitimacy and power. They could no longer govern effectively.
    *   **Formation of the First Non-Communist Government:** In August 1989, **Tadeusz Mazowiecki**, a prominent Solidarity intellectual and journalist, became the first non-communist Prime Minister of Poland in over 40 years. This was the first non-communist government in the entire Eastern Bloc.
    *   **Catalyst for the Fall of the Iron Curtain:** Poland's peaceful transition was a massive shock to the communist bloc. It demonstrated that communism could be defeated through elections and popular pressure. This event directly inspired and accelerated similar movements and changes in Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania.
    *   **Symbol of the End of the Cold War:** The Polish elections are widely seen as the **first major crack in the Iron Curtain** and the beginning of the end of communist rule in Eastern Europe. It set the stage for German reunification and the collapse of the Soviet Union itself.
    *   **Contrast with Tiananmen:** It's crucial to note that June 4th, 1989, is also the date of the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. These two events on the same day starkly illustrate the diverging paths of reform (and eventual peaceful transition) in Poland versus repression in China.

**In summary:** June 4th, 1989, was the day the Polish people, through semi-free elections, overwhelmingly rejected communism. This peaceful revolution led to the formation of the first non-communist government in the Eastern Bloc, acting as the critical domino that toppled the entire Soviet-controlled system and ended the Cold War in Europe. It remains a powerful symbol of the triumph of popular will over authoritarian rule.
