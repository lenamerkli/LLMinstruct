 A bunch of fellow trans people insulted me quite aggressively for being vegan/pro animal rights and it's just, tiring to think about.

I was posting in a space for trans people and the topic of veganism/animal cruelty came up. I gave my thoughts and holy fuck omnis are so sensitive. It's honestly frightening to see trans people whom have such good nuanced arguments typically surrounding our oppression switch so fast to reactionary name calling arguments.

I was called mentally ill, uneducated. I was told that I ruined the space because I was pro vegan. Was told that I was showing a victim complex. I never insulted any of them but my mental capacity was constantly brought into question. 6 people talking to me at once and getting told I'm a trash human being for believing consuming animals is wrong. Could barely respond to arguments because they were all so overwhelming and just rude from the start. In the end they removed me from the space which honestly, I'm glad I don't want to be around omnis like that.

I've experienced similar stuff but instead of my veganism it having been aimed at my identity. It's just so fucking weird seeing it from other trans people. Aggressively insulting me for being "mentally ill" when trans people are attacked for supposed mental illness constantly. Idk it just seems like you've learned literally nothing from your oppression. Part of the reason I went vegan was because honestly a lot of the disgusting shit said about vegans/complete lack of arguments reminded me of how I was treated as a trans person. It made me research more. It baffles me how much people will advocate and have intelligent opinions but when it comes to animals they act quite bigoted. It's so weird how fast people will switch up.

As a forum moderator, I've reviewed the post against the provided rules. Here's my assessment:

### Rule Compliance Check:
- **Rule 1 (Be Respectful and Courteous)**: The post expresses frustration and criticism about how the user was treated in a trans space for their vegan views. While it uses strong language (e.g., "holy fuck," "it's so fucking weird"), this appears to be emotional expression rather than personal attacks, harassment, or hate speech. Criticism is allowed under the rules, and the user is reporting their own negative experience without resorting to derogatory language about individuals or groups. The content is critical of specific behaviors ("reactionary name calling") but does not target anyone based on identity or personal characteristics.
  
- **Rule 2 (No Spam or Self-Promotion)**: The post is a single, cohesive narrative about a personal experience. It contains no advertisements, repetitive messages, or promotional links.

- **Rule 3 (Harmful Content)**: There is no promotion of violence, harm, or discrimination. The discussion of veganism and animal rights is an ethical topic, and the user does not advocate for harmful actions. The mention of being called "mentally ill" is used to highlight hypocrisy, not to promote stigma.

- **Rule 4 (Illegal Content)**: The content relates to lawful topics (veganism, online forums) and does not violate Swiss law.

- **Rule 5 (Protect Privacy and Personal Information)**: The post does not share any personal information about others (e.g., names, addresses). It discusses a group interaction but remains anonymized.

- **Rule 6 (Appropriate Content/NSFW/Gore)**: The text is suitable for a general audience. There are no explicit, violent, or disturbing elements.

- **Rule 7 (Screen Reader Accessible)**: The post uses standard text without ascii art or leetspeak, making it screen-reader friendly.

### Moderator Decision:
**This post is allowed.** It does not violate any forum rules. The user's expression of frustration is a valid critique of the situation they experienced, and it falls within the bounds of respectful discussion. While the language is emotional, it is not abusive or inflammatory toward protected groups. The post serves as a personal account that contributes to the forum's discourse on allyship and intersectionality.

If this post leads to further discussion, please encourage respectful dialogue. If you see replies that violate the rules, flag them for moderation.
