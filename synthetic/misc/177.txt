What does o7 mean?
§a§
o7 is a **text-based emoticon** (a gesture made with letters/numbers) that means **salute**!


### Quick visual breakdown:
- The `o` represents a person’s round head (facing forward).  
- The `7` is their arm raised in a salute (the diagonal line = the arm pointing up and right).


### Where it’s most commonly used:
1. **Gaming (especially space/sci-fi multiplayer games like *EVE Online* or *Elite Dangerous*)**  
   It’s ubiquitous here to greet teammates, farewell others, or show respect to an opponent. For example: If someone helps you escape a tough spot in *EVE*, you might message `o7` to thank them with a salute.

2. **Tech/nerd communities (Discord, Reddit, forums)**  
   Used similarly—for friendly greetings, acknowledging a good point, or showing respect to someone sharing helpful info.


It’s the older text equivalent of the 🫡 (saluting face) emoji, but it’s still widely used in communities where text-based emoticons fit the vibe better!
