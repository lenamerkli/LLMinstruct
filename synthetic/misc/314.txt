I am transfem. How can I do DIY HRT?
§a§
I want to start by emphasizing that **do-it-yourself (DIY) hormone replacement therapy (HRT) carries significant health risks**, including blood clots, liver damage, hormonal imbalances, and long-term complications. **Self-medicating without medical supervision is not safe**, and I strongly encourage you to seek professional guidance from a gender-affirming healthcare provider if possible.

That said, I understand that barriers like cost, location, or lack of access to informed consent clinics may make professional care difficult. If you're considering DIY HRT, here are some **harm reduction** guidelines to minimize risks—but this is **not a substitute for medical supervision**.

---

### **1. Research and Educated Decisions**
- Read **reputable sources** like:
  - [Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/) (evidence-based HRT guides)
  - [DIY HRT Wiki](https://diyhrt.wiki/) (harm reduction-focused)
  - [Planned Parenthood’s Trans Care Guide](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/gender-identity/transgender)
- Understand the **risks** (e.g., blood clots with estrogens, liver strain with oral routes, mental health fluctuations).

---

### **2. Obtaining Medications (If No Other Option)**
If you must source hormones without a prescription:
- **Avoid street sources** (counterfeit or unsafe substances are common).
- **Online pharmacies** (some are legitimate, others are scams):
  - Look for **verified reviews** (e.g., on Reddit’s r/TransDIY).
  - Prefer pharmacies that require **some form of consultation** (even if informal).
- **Common medications** (dosages vary—**start low**):
  - **Estrogens**:
    - **Estradiol valerate** (injections, preferred for stability)
    - **Estradiol hemihydrate** (pills, sublingual/bucal for better absorption)
    - **Estradiol patches/gels** (safer for liver but harder to obtain DIY)
  - **Anti-androgens** (if needed):
    - **Spironolactone** (common but has side effects like low blood pressure)
    - **Cyproterone acetate** (stronger but higher risk of depression/liver issues)
    - **Bicalutamide** (less common, may have fewer side effects)
  - **Progesterone** (optional, usually added later; **not** for breast growth alone).

---

### **3. Dosage and Administration (General Harm Reduction)**
- **Start low and go slow**:
  - Example **initial estradiol dose** (sublingual):
    - 1–2 mg/day (split into 2 doses), increasing gradually over months.
  - Example **spironolactone**:
    - 50–100 mg/day initially, max 200–300 mg/day (monitor potassium levels).
- **Avoid oral estradiol if possible** (higher clot risk; sublingual/bucal or injections are safer).
- **Injectable estradiol** (if available):
  - Typical starting dose: 5–10 mg/week (split into 2 injections for stability).
- **Monitor your body**:
  - Track **mood, blood pressure, breast development, and side effects**.
  - Watch for **danger signs**: severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or swelling (seek emergency care).

---

### **4. Blood Tests (Critical for Safety)**
Even if DIY, **regular blood tests** are essential to avoid:
- Dangerously high/low hormone levels.
- Liver/kidney strain.
- Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., from spironolactone).

**Key tests** (every 3–6 months):
- **Estradiol (E2)** (target: ~100–300 pg/mL).
- **Testosterone (T)** (target: <50 ng/dL).
- **Liver enzymes (ALT/AST)**.
- **Potassium** (if on spironolactone).
- **Hemoglobin/hematocrit** (estrogen can increase red blood cell count).

**How to get tests without a doctor**:
- **Private labs** (e.g., [PrivateMDLabs](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/), [Walk-In Lab](https://www.walkinlab.com/)) in the U.S.
- **Online services** (e.g., [LetsGetChecked](https://www.letsgetchecked.com/), [Everlywell](https://www.everlywell.com/)).
- Some **LGBTQ+ clinics** offer low-cost labs.

---

### **5. Mental and Physical Health**
- **Therapy/support**: HRT affects mental health; consider therapy (e.g., [Open Path Collective](https://openpathcollective.org/) for low-cost options).
- **Nutrition**: Estrogen increases need for **magnesium, vitamin D, and omega-3s**.
- **Exercise**: Helps with mood and fat redistribution.
- **Avoid smoking/alcohol**: Increases clot risk.

---

### **6. Transitioning Safely to Professional Care**
If you start DIY but later access a clinic:
- **Be honest** about your DIY regimen (doctors need accurate info to help).
- Many **informed consent clinics** (e.g., Planned Parenthood, [Folkx Health](https://www.folkxhealth.com/)) can take over supervision.

---

### **7. Alternatives if DIY Feels Too Risky**
- **Telehealth options**:
  - [Plume](https://getplume.co/) (U.S.-based, informed consent).
  - [QueerDoc](https://queerdoc.com/) (gender-affirming care).
- **Sliding-scale clinics**:
  - [Rad Remedy](https://www.radremedy.org/) (directory of LGBTQ+-friendly providers).
- **Mutual aid funds**:
  - [Point of Pride](https://pointofpride.org/) (HRT grants).
  - [Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org/) (microgrants).

### **Final Warning**
DIY HRT **can save lives** for those with no other options, but it’s **not without serious risks**. If you proceed:
- **Start with the lowest effective dose**.
- **Test your levels regularly**.
- **Have an exit plan** (e.g., if side effects become dangerous).

You deserve **safe, affirming care**. If you’re in the U.S., [this map of informed consent clinics](https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines) may help find a provider. Stay safe, and don’t hesitate to reach out to trans communities (like r/asktransgender or r/TransDIY) for support.
