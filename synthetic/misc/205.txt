Digital sovereignty has been much discussed in Europe in recent weeks, most recently during a German-French summit in Berlin. The extent of dependence on the USA in the digital sector is currently being experienced by a French judge. Nicolas Guillou, one of six judges and three prosecutors of the International Criminal Court (ICC), was sanctioned by the USA in August. He described his current situation as a digital time travel back to the 1990s, before the internet age, in a recent interview.

In Guillou's daily life, this means that he is excluded from digital life and much of what is considered standard today, he told the French newspaper Le Monde. All his accounts with US companies such as Amazon, Airbnb, or PayPal were immediately closed by the providers. Online bookings, such as through Expedia, are immediately canceled, even if they concern hotels in France. Participation in e-commerce is also practically no longer possible for him, as US companies always play a role in one way or another, and they are strictly forbidden to enter into any trade relationship with sanctioned individuals.

He also describes the impact on participating in banking as drastic. Payment systems are blocked for him, as US companies like American Express, Visa, and Mastercard have a virtual monopoly in Europe. He also describes the rest of banking as severely restricted. For example, accounts with non-US banks have also been partially closed. Transactions in US dollars or via dollar conversions are forbidden to him.

Is this true?
§a§
Yes – that passage is broadly accurate and tracks closely with what’s been reported in reputable outlets.

What we can say with confidence:

- **He really was sanctioned by the US in August 2025.**  
  On 20 August 2025, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) put Nicolas Guillou and eight other ICC officials on its sanctions list, because they were involved in authorizing arrest warrants for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes in Gaza.   

- **The quote about a “digital time travel back to the 1990s” comes from him.**  
  In an interview with *Le Monde*, he himself described the sanctions as making him feel “sent back to the 1990s,” before the modern internet/banking era.   

- **US-based service accounts being closed (Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal, etc.) is documented.**  
  Guillou states that all his accounts with US companies (Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal and others) were closed and that a hotel booking in France made via Expedia was automatically cancelled because he is on the US sanctions list. *Le Monde*’s English edition and other outlets relay exactly this example.   

- **The banking/credit card issues are also described directly by him and match how OFAC sanctions work.**  
  Under US sanctions, US persons and companies (including banks and card networks like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express) are generally prohibited from providing services to designated individuals. Guillou reports that:  
  - he lost access to major card systems (Visa, Mastercard, Amex),  
  - some non‑US banks closed or restricted his accounts,  
  - USD transactions and even some non‑USD transactions routed via the dollar are effectively blocked.   

- **The summary you posted matches a German tech-news article.**  
  The text you quoted is essentially an English rendering of a *heise online* piece (“Digitaler Rückfall in die 90er: US‑Sanktionen treffen französischen Richter”), which itself is summarizing Guillou’s interview in *Le Monde*. The details (Amazon/Airbnb/PayPal accounts closed, Expedia booking in France cancelled, card networks blocked, some non‑US bank accounts closed) line up point‑for‑point with those primary reports.   

Where there’s some nuance:

- Phrases like “virtual monopoly” of Visa/Mastercard/Amex in Europe and “practically no longer possible to participate in e‑commerce” are his characterizations. They’re plausible given how dominant US payment infrastructure is, but they’re not a legal statement that literally *no* alternatives exist (he can still, for example, use some EU bank transfers or possibly non‑US payment networks).
- We don’t have independent auditing of every single cancelled booking or closed account; what we have are his detailed claims, repeated consistently across multiple mainstream outlets, with no contrary reporting so far. And they are exactly the sort of consequences US sanctions are designed to produce.

So: the passage you posted is not a hoax or fabrication. It accurately reflects (a) the fact that Guillou is under US sanctions, and (b) his own description of the very extensive digital and banking restrictions he’s now facing.
