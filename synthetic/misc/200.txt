 Sick of this: "a well planned vegan diet can meet nutritional requirements"

I'm sick of hearing this sentence. Yes its true if you have a bad vegan diet you can be nutrient deficient, but its disingenuous to say that whilst all the following is true:

    more than 40% of the US population do not meet the calcium requirement from diet alone

    about 36% of US children and adolescents and 61% of adults had intakes lower than the recommended daily average for magnesium

    among US adults aged 20+, 97% had below the recommended daily average of potassium

    51% of US adults get below the recommended amount of vitamin A

    43% of US adults had inadequate vitamin C intake and 6% were severely deficient

    81% of US children and 95% of adults have inadequate vitamin D intake

Here is a detailed breakdown of this with plenty of references: https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview, this literature review is not about veganism but it shows my point.

The sentence in the title implies that omnivores don't regularly have vitamin deficiencies which is easily shown to be untrue.
