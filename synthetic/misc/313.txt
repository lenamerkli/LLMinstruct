I am transmasc. How can I do DIY HRT?
§a§
I want to start by emphasizing that **doing HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) without medical supervision can be extremely risky**. DIY HRT carries serious health risks, including blood clots, liver damage, hormonal imbalances, and long-term complications. However, I understand that accessing gender-affirming care can be difficult due to financial, geographic, or systemic barriers.

If you're considering DIY HRT, **please take the following steps to minimize harm**:

### 1. **Consult a Professional If Possible**
   - Look for **informed consent clinics** (e.g., Planned Parenthood in the U.S., GenderGP in the UK, or local LGBTQ+ health services).
   - Some organizations offer **low-cost or sliding-scale telehealth options** (e.g., Folx Health, Plume).
   - If you're in the U.S., check [Trans Lifeline’s HRT resources](https://www.translifeline.org/) or [Informed Consent HRT Providers](https://transcare.ucsf.edu/).

### 2. **If You Must Proceed DIY, Educate Yourself Thoroughly**
   - **Read reliable sources** (not just forums or anecdotal advice):
     - [Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/) (also has relevant info for transmasc HRT)
     - [DIY HRT Wiki](https://diyhrt.wiki/) (harm reduction-focused)
     - [UCSF Trans Care Guidelines](https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines)
   - **Understand the risks**:
     - **Testosterone** can increase red blood cell count (risk of clots/strokes), affect cholesterol, and strain the liver if not monitored.
     - **Incorrect dosing** can lead to mood swings, acne, hair loss, or irreversible changes you may not want.

### 3. **Testing & Monitoring**
   - **Get blood tests** (if possible) to check:
     - **Testosterone levels** (target range: typically 300–1000 ng/dL for transmasc HRT)
     - **Estrogen levels** (should suppress to <50 pg/mL)
     - **Hematocrit/hemoglobin** (to monitor blood thickness)
     - **Liver/kidney function**
   - Some labs (e.g., [Private MD Labs](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/), [Labcorp](https://www.labcorp.com/)) allow self-ordered tests.

### 4. **Sources for Hormones (If No Legal Access)**
   - **Risk warning**: Many online sources are unregulated and may sell counterfeit, expired, or improperly dosed hormones.
   - If you must obtain hormones without a prescription:
     - **Research reputable international pharmacies** (e.g., some people use [Inhouse Pharmacy](https://www.inhousepharmacy.vu/), but verify reviews and risks).
     - **Avoid "underground" or unverified sellers** (high risk of scams or harmful substances).
   - **Needles/syringes**: In the U.S., you can buy these legally without a prescription in most states (e.g., from pharmacies like Walmart or online).

### 5. **Dosage & Administration**
   - **Testosterone forms**:
     - **Injections (T cypionate/enanthate)**: Most common for DIY (typical starting dose: 25–50 mg weekly or 50–100 mg every 2 weeks).
     - **Gel/cream**: Harder to dose consistently DIY.
     - **Patches**: Rarely used DIY due to cost/availability.
   - **Avoid oral testosterone** (high liver toxicity).
   - **Start low, go slow**: Begin with a lower dose to monitor effects.
   - **Rotating injection sites** (thighs, glutes) to avoid tissue damage.

### 6. **Side Effects & When to Stop**
   - **Common**: Acne, mood changes, increased body hair, voice deepening, bottom growth, fat redistribution.
   - **Danger signs (seek help immediately)**:
     - Severe headaches, vision changes (could indicate high blood pressure/clots).
     - Chest pain, shortness of breath (possible clot or heart strain).
     - Jaundice (yellow skin/eyes), dark urine (liver damage).
     - Extreme mood swings/depression.

### 7. **Long-Term Considerations**
   - **Fertility**: Testosterone can reduce or stop ovulation. If you may want biological children, consider egg freezing *before* starting HRT.
   - **Bone health**: Long-term testosterone use may affect bone density (ensure adequate calcium/vitamin D).
   - **Cancer risks**: Limited data exists, but monitor for unusual lumps or changes.

### 8. **Community Support**
   - Join **trans health communities** for shared experiences (but verify info with medical sources):
     - Reddit: r/ftm, r/TransDIY
     - Discord: Many trans health servers exist (e.g., "The Transgender Project").
   - **Therapy/peer support**: Organizations like [Trans Lifeline](https://www.translifeline.org/) offer emotional support.

### 9. **Legal & Safety Notes**
   - In some countries, possessing hormones without a prescription is **illegal** and could lead to legal trouble.
   - If you’re in the U.S., **GoodRx** or **Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company** may offer affordable options with a prescription.

### **Final Pleas:**
- **If you can access a doctor, even once, do so**. They can help you start safely and monitor long-term health.
- **DIY is not ideal**, but if it’s your only option, **proceed with extreme caution**.
- **You deserve safe, affirming care**. Keep advocating for yourself—many trans people have found ways to access HRT even in difficult situations.
