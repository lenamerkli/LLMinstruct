### Country of Origin for the Statistic

The provided CSV data lists common surnames along with their ranks and associated numbers (likely representing population counts or frequency). Based on the surnames, this statistic is **most likely from Switzerland**.

#### Reasons:

1. **Common Swiss-German Surnames:**
    - The surnames listed—**Müller, Meier, Schmid, Keller, Weber, Schneider, Huber, Meyer, Steiner**—are extremely common in Switzerland, particularly in the German-speaking regions. These names frequently appear at the top of surname lists in Switzerland.
	- For example, official statistics from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS) consistently show Müller, Meier, and Schmid among the top surnames.


2.  **Spelling Variations:**
    - **“Schmid”** instead of “Schmidt”. In Germany, “Schmidt” is more common, while “Schmid” is the prevalent spelling in Switzerland and Austria. The presence of “Schmid” as the 3rd most common surname strongly points to Switzerland.
	- **“Huber”** is another very common Swiss surname and is ranked 7th in this list. While it is also found in Austria it is more prevalent in Switzerland.

3. **Presence of “da Silva”:**
	- **“da Silva”** is a very common Portuguese/Brazilian surname. Its appearance at rank 8 indicates a significant immigrant population. Switzerland has a large immigrant community, including people from Brazil and other Portuguese-speaking countries. Recent immigration has caused surnames like da Silva to rise in the rankings. This is consistent with current Swiss demographic data where da Silva often appears in the top 10 surnames due to immigration.

4.  **Comparison with other German-speaking countries:**
    - **Germany:** The top surnames differ. For example Schmidt (not Schmid) is rank 2, and Fischer, Wagner, and Schulz would typically be in the top 10—in contrast this list.
    - **Austria:** Common surnames include Gruber, Bauer, and Moser, which are absent here. While Huber and Steiner are common in Austria, the overall list matches Switzerland more closely.
	- **Liechtenstein:** The population is too small for such statistics and the surname distribution would be very similar to Austria.

**Conclusion:** The statistic is from **Switzerland**. The combination of Swiss-German surnames, the specific spelling of "Schmid", and the inclusion of “da Silva” due to immigration all confirm this.
