What is the minimal version of llama.cpp to run apertus?
§a§
The minimum version of llama.cpp required to run Apertus models is **b6686** or newer. This version added support for the Apertus architecture, which uses a novel xIELU activation function and other custom components.

If you attempt to use an older version of llama.cpp, you will encounter an error message stating:

```
error loading model architecture: unknown model architecture: 'apertus'
```

This error occurs because earlier versions of llama.cpp did not recognize the Apertus architecture.
