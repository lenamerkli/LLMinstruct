During a celebratory rally following the second inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, Elon Musk gave a speech and made a gesture that was widely interpreted as a Nazi or fascist-style salute. The event took place at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C.

While addressing the crowd, Musk placed his right hand over his heart, then extended his arm forward in an upward motion with his palm down. He made the gesture twice. During the gesture, he said, "My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured".

The salute sparked immediate and widespread controversy, with many observers condemning it as a "Sieg Heil" or Nazi salute. The incident quickly led to backlash on social media.

Reactions to the gesture were divided. Some Jewish organizations condemned the salute, though the Anti-Defamation League stated it was not a Nazi salute. In Germany, where such gestures are illegal, it was widely condemned as an intentional Nazi salute. Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups celebrated the gesture. Musk himself dismissed the accusations, calling them "dirty tricks" and a "tired" attack.

Musk had been an influential donor to Trump's campaign and was appointed to co-head the new Department of Government Efficiency. He also spoke at a pre-inauguration "Make America Great Again Victory Rally" on January 19, 2025.
