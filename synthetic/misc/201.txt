For each country on the european continent, what culinary horror exists there?
§a§
It’s critical to emphasize that the term "culinary horror" here is entirely subjective, rooted in unfamiliarity with regional ingredients, preparations, or cultural food traditions—these dishes are often beloved, historic staples in their respective countries, valued for their flavor, heritage, and nourishment. Below is a breakdown by European nation:

- **Albania**: Petë me mish (scrambled lamb brains and eggs). The texture of organ meat and the idea of eating brains can be jarring to unaccustomed palates.  
- **Andorra**: Truita de Crespells (fried bull testicles). A Pyrenean specialty, the offal component and unfamiliar texture often strike outsiders as unappealing.  
- **Austria**: Saure Kutteln (sour tripe). Tripe’s rubbery texture and the dish’s tangy, fermented flavor profile are common sources of aversion.  
- **Belarus**: Krovyanaya Kasha (blood porridge). Made with pig’s blood, barley, and spices, the blood’s earthy taste and dark appearance can be unsettling.  
- **Belgium**: Konijn in Chocolade (rabbit in chocolate sauce). The sweet-savory combination of gamey rabbit and rich chocolate strikes many as a bizarre, unappetizing pairing.  
- **Bosnia and Herzegovina**: Škembići (tripe soup). A pungent, garlicky stew of beef or lamb tripe; the offal base and strong aroma are off-putting to some.  
- **Bulgaria**: Shkembe Chorba (tripe soup). Infamous for its sharp, vinegary tang and tripe’s chewy texture, it’s often cited as a polarizing acquired taste.  
- **Croatia**: Sardele u Šunku (fermented herring). Salted and fermented in jars, it has a strong, fishy odor and briny taste that can overwhelm outsiders.  
- **Cyprus**: Kokoretsi. Grilled lamb or pork intestines wrapped around a mix of offal (heart, liver, lungs); the combination of organ meats and intestinal casing is often seen as horrifying.  
- **Czech Republic**: Ještěrbíci (breaded fried calf brains). The delicate, creamy texture of brains and the idea of eating them are unappealing to many.  
- **Denmark**: Blodpølse (blood sausage). A dense sausage made with pig’s blood, barley, and spices; served with applesauce, its earthy flavor and blood content can be jarring.  
- **Estonia**: Verivorst (blood sausage). Similar to other Baltic blood sausages, its metallic tang and dark color are often off-putting to outsiders.  
- **Finland**: Mustamakkara (black blood sausage). A grilled sausage made with pig’s blood and barley, served with lingonberry jam; its strong, iron-rich taste is polarizing.  
- **France**: Andouillette. A sausage made with pork intestines, with a pungent, gamey smell and chewy texture that many find repulsive.  
- **Germany**: Mett (raw ground pork). Often spread on bread with onions, the risk of foodborne illness (perceived or real) and raw meat texture horrify some.  
- **Greece**: Kokoretsi (same as Cyprus). The mix of grilled offal and intestinal casing is seen as unappetizing by those unused to organ meat preparations.  
- **Hungary**: Vérpaszta (blood pasta). Pasta dough mixed with pig’s blood, giving it a dark color and iron-rich taste that can be unsettling.  
- **Iceland**: Hákarl (fermented shark). Infamously pungent, with an ammonia-like smell and bitter, gamey taste from months of fermentation.  
- **Ireland**: Drisheen (blood pudding). A dense, firm pudding made with sheep’s blood and oatmeal; its texture and blood content are often a turnoff.  
- **Italy**: Casu Marzu (fermented sheep’s cheese). A Sardinian specialty teeming with live maggots (which aid fermentation); the maggots and rotten smell make it one of the world’s most notorious "horror" foods.  
- **Kosovo**: Škembići (tripe soup). A hearty, pungent stew of tripe and spices; the offal base is unappealing to many outsiders.  
- **Latvia**: Galerts (meat aspic). Made with pork head, feet, and ears simmered until the stock gels; the jiggly texture and use of lesser-known meat parts horrify some.  
- **Liechtenstein**: Saure Kutteln (sour tripe). Shared with neighboring Austria and Switzerland, its tangy tripe preparation is a common acquired taste.  
- **Lithuania**: Vėdarai (stuffed pig’s stomach). Pig’s stomach filled with buckwheat and pig’s blood; the casing and blood content are often seen as unappetizing.  
- **Luxembourg**: Tripala (tripe stew). A creamy or tomato-based tripe dish; the offal’s texture and strong flavor are polarizing.  
- **Malta**: Kidonja (fermented mullet). A traditional fermented fish dish with a strong, pungent odor that many find overwhelming.  
- **Moldova**: Caltaboș (stuffed pig’s stomach). Similar to Lithuania’s vėdarai, it’s filled with blood and grits, with a casing and flavor that can jar unaccustomed palates.  
- **Monaco**: Stocafi (dried cod stew). Dried cod rehydrated and stewed in tomatoes; its chewy texture and strong, fishy taste are off-putting to some.  
- **Montenegro**: Škembići (tripe soup). A pungent, offal-based stew common in the Balkans, seen as unappealing by outsiders.  
- **Netherlands**: Haring (raw herring). Eaten whole (often by the tail) with onions, the raw fish’s texture and strong flavor horrify many.  
- **North Macedonia**: Škembići (tripe soup). A hearty, spicy tripe stew; the offal component is a common source of aversion.  
- **Norway**: Rakfisk (fermented trout). Fermented for months, it has a strong, ammonia-like smell and tangy taste that repels most outsiders.  
- **Poland**: Flaki (tripe soup). A rich, aromatic stew with tripe; its strong smell and chewy texture are often seen as unappetizing.  
- **Portugal**: Arroz de Cabidela (blood rice). Rice cooked with chicken blood (and often the chicken’s organs), giving it a dark color and iron-rich taste.  
- **Romania**: Caltaboș (stuffed pig’s stomach). A traditional dish of pig’s stomach filled with blood and buckwheat; the casing and blood content are jarring to some.  
- **San Marino**: Trippa alla Romana (Roman-style tripe). Tripe stewed in tomatoes, garlic, and mint; the offal base is an acquired taste for outsiders.  
- **Serbia**: Škembići (tripe soup). A pungent, garlicky tripe stew; the offal component and strong aroma are unappealing to many.  
- **Slovakia**: Škembičová Polievka (tripe soup). A tangy, offal-based stew with a strong smell that can repel unaccustomed eaters.  
- **Slovenia**: Škembični Juha (tripe soup). A hearty, spicy tripe stew; the offal’s texture and flavor are polarizing.  
- **Spain**: Callos a la Madrileña (Madrid-style tripe stew). A rich stew of tripe, chorizo, and tomatoes; the tripe’s rubbery texture is often seen as horrifying.  
- **Sweden**: Surströmming (fermented herring). Canned and fermented, it has a notoriously putrid smell (compared to rotten eggs) that makes it a global "horror" staple.  
- **Switzerland**: Tête de Veau (calf’s head). Served whole or in pieces (including tongue, eyes, and cheeks); the use of the entire head is unsettling to many outsiders.  
- **Ukraine**: Kholodets (meat aspic). A jelly made from pork head, feet, and ears; its jiggly texture and use of lesser-known meat parts horrify some.  
- **United Kingdom**: Stargazy Pie (Cornish specialty). A fish pie with herring or mackerel heads protruding through the crust (to "gaze at the stars"); the visual alone repels many outsiders, paired with the fishy, gelatinous filling.

Which of those are not vegan?
§a§
Every single one of the listed dishes is non-vegan. All contain animal-derived ingredients that violate vegan dietary principles (which exclude meat, fish, dairy, eggs, blood, gelatin, and other animal products or byproducts). To break down the common non-vegan components:

- **Meat/offal/organs**: Tripe, lamb brains, bull testicles, rabbit, pig intestines/casing/stomach, calf brains/head, chicken organs, herring, shark, cod, trout, mackerel, raw pork, chorizo, pork head/feet/ears, lamb/pork heart/liver/lungs.  
- **Blood**: Pig, sheep, or chicken blood (used in porridge, sausages, pasta, rice, and stuffed dishes).  
- **Dairy**: Casu Marzu (fermented sheep’s cheese).  
- **Eggs**: Petë me mish (scrambled lamb brains and eggs).  
- **Animal-derived gelatin**: Meat aspic (galerts, kholodets), which relies on collagen from animal bones/connective tissue to gel.  

There are no vegan dishes among the ones previously categorized as "culinary horror"—all depend on animal products as their core ingredients.
