# Sample Answers for "The Great Gatsby" Exam Questions

## 1. How does Fitzgerald use symbolism to develop the theme of the American Dream?

Fitzgerald masterfully employs symbolism throughout "The Great Gatsby" to explore the corruption and ultimate impossibility of the American Dream.

The most prominent symbol is **the green light** at the end of Daisy's dock. This light represents Gatsby's hopes and dreams, particularly his desire to win Daisy back and achieve the perfect life he imagines. Nick notes that "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us." This symbol illustrates how the American Dream—once a promise of opportunity through hard work—has become an unattainable illusion, always visible but forever out of reach.

**The Valley of Ashes** symbolizes the moral and social decay hidden beneath the glamorous surface of wealth. This "desolate area of land" between West Egg and New York City represents the forgotten working class and the consequences of the wealthy's careless pursuit of pleasure. It serves as a reminder that the American Dream has failed many, leaving them in a state of hopelessness.

**The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg** on the billboard overlooking the Valley of Ashes represent a god-like presence watching over the moral corruption of the era. When George Wilson looks at the eyes before killing Gatsby, he mistakes them for the eyes of God, suggesting that traditional moral values have been replaced by commercialism in the pursuit of the American Dream.

Through these symbols, Fitzgerald demonstrates how the American Dream has been corrupted by materialism and class division, becoming an empty promise that ultimately leads to destruction rather than fulfillment.

## 2. Analyze the character of Jay Gatsby. Is he a tragic hero?

Jay Gatsby can be considered a tragic hero in the classical sense, as he possesses noble qualities but is ultimately destroyed by a fatal flaw.

Gatsby's **noble quality** is his extraordinary capacity for hope and his unwavering devotion to an idealized dream. Nick describes him as having "an extraordinary gift for hope" and a "romantic readiness." Unlike the cynical characters around him, Gatsby genuinely believes in the possibility of recreating the past and achieving perfection through his pursuit of Daisy.

However, Gatsby's **tragic flaw** is his inability to distinguish between his idealized vision of Daisy and the reality of who she has become. He creates a "colossal vitality of his illusion" around Daisy, refusing to see her as the shallow, careless person she has become. This flaw leads to his downfall, as he sacrifices everything for a dream that was never attainable.

Gatsby also demonstrates the **tragic hero's capacity for self-awareness** in his final moments. When Nick asks him what he thinks of the "disgraceful" scene of Daisy and Tom's reconciliation, Gatsby responds, "Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can!" This shows his tragic inability to accept reality.

Like classical tragic heroes, Gatsby achieves **a kind of nobility in death**. Despite his questionable business dealings and the superficiality of his lifestyle, he dies protecting Daisy's reputation, taking the blame for Myrtle's death. Nick recognizes this nobility when he reflects, "They're a rotten crowd... You're worth the whole damn bunch put together."

Gatsby's tragic status is solidified by the fact that his death goes largely unnoticed by those who enjoyed his hospitality, highlighting the emptiness of the world he inhabited and the futility of his American Dream.

## 3. Compare and contrast East Egg and West Egg. What do they represent?

East Egg and West Egg represent the geographical and social divisions that characterize the world of "The Great Gatsby," symbolizing the conflict between established aristocracy and newly acquired wealth.

**East Egg** represents "old money"—families who have inherited their wealth over generations and who belong to the traditional American upper class. Its residents, like Tom and Daisy Buchanan, are characterized by their social grace, cultural refinement, and sense of entitlement. Nick describes East Egg as the "more fashionable" of the two Eggs, with "white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water." However, beneath this polished exterior lies moral corruption, carelessness, and a lack of empathy for others.

**West Egg** represents "new money"—those who have recently acquired their wealth, often through questionable means. Its residents, like Gatsby, are characterized by their extravagant displays of wealth, social aspirations, and lack of cultural refinement. Nick describes West Egg as the "less fashionable" of the two Eggs, with "queer, glittering" houses that are "a copy of a Hotel de Ville in Normandy." Despite their material success, West Egg residents remain outsiders to the established social order.

The **contrast between the two Eggs** highlights the class divisions and social tensions of the 1920s. While both communities share wealth, they differ in their attitudes, values, and social standing. The Buchanan's look down on Gatsby not just because of his questionable business dealings but because his wealth lacks the legitimacy of inheritance.

The Eggs also symbolize the **American Dream's corruption**. Rather than being a place where anyone can succeed through hard work and merit, society is divided between those who were born into privilege and those who remain social outsiders despite their wealth. This division ultimately proves insurmountable for Gatsby, whose dream of bridging this gap through his relationship with Daisy ends in tragedy.

## 4. Discuss the role of the narrator, Nick Carraway. Is he reliable?

Nick Carraway serves as both narrator and participant in "The Great Gatsby," and his reliability as a narrator is complex and worth examining.

**As a narrator**, Nick provides the lens through which we view all events and characters. He claims at the beginning of the novel that he is "inclined to reserve all judgments," suggesting an objective stance. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Nick's judgment is not entirely reserved. He becomes increasingly involved in the events he narrates and develops strong opinions about the characters, particularly Gatsby.

**Nick's reliability** is questionable for several reasons:

1. **Personal involvement**: Nick becomes emotionally invested in Gatsby's story, admitting at the end that he "disapproved of him from beginning to end" but still found him "worth the whole damn bunch put together." This emotional attachment colors his narration.

2. **Selective storytelling**: Nick chooses what to include and exclude from his account, focusing on aspects that support his interpretation of events and characters.

3. **Temporal distance**: Nick is telling the story two years after it happened, which may affect his memory and perspective.

4. **Moral judgments**: Despite claiming to reserve judgment, Nick frequently makes moral evaluations of characters, particularly condemning Tom and Daisy as "careless people" who "smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money."

Despite these limitations, Nick remains **relatively reliable** compared to other potential narrators. He acknowledges his biases and limitations, admitting, "I am aware of a certain basic inadequacy in myself that makes me want to reserve my judgments." His self-awareness makes him more trustworthy than a narrator who pretends to be completely objective.

Nick's position as both an insider (through his family connections) and an outsider (through his Midwestern values and moral perspective) gives him a unique vantage point from which to observe and critique the decadence of the East Coast elite. His gradual disillusionment with the world he encounters mirrors the reader's own journey through the novel.

## 5. How does the novel critique the moral values of the 1920s?

"The Great Gatsby" serves as a powerful critique of the moral values of the 1920s, revealing the corruption and emptiness beneath the decade's glamorous surface.

**The novel critiques materialism** through its portrayal of characters who measure worth in terms of wealth and possessions. Gatsby believes money can buy him happiness and Daisy's love, filling his mansion with expensive but ultimately meaningless objects. The parties he throws are spectacular but impersonal, with guests who "conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks." This critique suggests that the pursuit of wealth has replaced more traditional moral values.

**Fitzgerald critiques the moral decay of the upper class** through characters like Tom and Daisy Buchanan, who are "careless people" who "smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness." Their wealth shields them from consequences, allowing them to destroy lives without taking responsibility. When Daisy kills Myrtle Wilson, she lets Gatsby take the blame and then disappears with Tom, leaving Gatsby to face the consequences alone.

**The novel critiques the corruption of the American Dream**, showing how it has transformed from a promise of opportunity through hard work into a quest for quick wealth and social status. Gatsby's involvement in bootlegging and other shady business activities represents the moral compromises necessary to achieve rapid success in this new version of the American Dream.

**The novel also critiques the treatment of women** in the 1920s. Despite appearances of greater freedom, female characters like Daisy and Myrtle remain trapped in limited roles, valued primarily for their beauty and usefulness to men. Daisy's comment about her daughter—"I hope she'll be a fool—that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool"—reveals the limited options available to women.

Through these critiques, Fitzgerald paints a portrait of a society that has lost its moral compass, pursuing pleasure and wealth at the expense of human connection, responsibility, and integrity. The novel suggests that the glittering surface of the Jazz Age conceals a spiritual emptiness and moral decay that ultimately leads to tragedy.

## 6. Analyze the significance of the final line of the novel.

The final line of "The Great Gatsby"—"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past"—is one of the most famous concluding lines in American literature and carries profound significance.

**Thematically**, this line encapsulates the novel's central meditation on time, memory, and the impossibility of escaping the past. Throughout the novel, characters struggle with their relationship to the past—Gatsby tries to recreate his past with Daisy, Nick reflects on his Midwestern values, and Tom and Daisy retreat to the comfort of their established social position. The metaphor of "boats against the current" suggests the futility of human efforts to move forward when we are constantly pulled back by our histories.

**Symbolically**, this line connects to the novel's water imagery, including the bay separating East and West Egg, the swimming pool where Gatsby dies, and the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg looking over the Valley of Ashes. Water in the novel often represents both possibility and limitation, and this final image reinforces that duality.

**In terms of character**, the line particularly applies to Gatsby, whose entire life was an attempt to overcome his past and create a new identity. Despite his wealth and success, he could never escape his origins or his memories of Daisy. His tragic end demonstrates the impossibility of outrunning one's history.

**Philosophically**, the line suggests a pessimistic view of human progress and the American Dream. Rather than moving forward toward a better future, humans are "borne back ceaselessly into the past," trapped by nostalgia, regret, and the weight of history. This contrasts sharply with the traditional American narrative of progress and forward movement.

**For the reader**, this final line transforms what might otherwise be a simple story of love and betrayal into a profound meditation on the human condition. It elevates Gatsby's personal tragedy into a universal statement about the struggle between hope and reality, dreams and limitations, past and future.

The line's poetic quality—its rhythm, imagery, and metaphorical richness—also demonstrates Fitzgerald's literary artistry, providing a fitting conclusion to a novel that is as much about language and style as it is about characters and events.

## 7. Discuss the role of women in the novel.

The role of women in "The Great Gatsby" reveals much about the social constraints and gender dynamics of the 1920s, despite the appearance of greater freedom during the Jazz Age.

**Daisy Buchanan** represents the traditional upper-class woman who is both objectified and protected by her social position. She is described primarily in terms of her beauty and voice—her voice is "full of money" and "low, thrilling." Despite her charm and intelligence, Daisy is ultimately limited by her dependence on men for social and economic security. Her decision to remain with Tom rather than leave with Gatsby reflects her understanding that her position in society depends on maintaining her marriage and status. Her comment about hoping her daughter will be "a beautiful little fool" reveals her awareness of the limited options available to women in her world.

**Jordan Baker** represents the "new woman" of the 1920s—independent, career-oriented, and somewhat cynical. As a professional golfer, she has achieved a degree of financial independence unusual for women of the time. However, Nick's description of her as "incurably dishonest" and her involvement in cheating scandals suggest that Fitzgerald views this independence with suspicion. Jordan's character demonstrates the limited ways in which women could exercise autonomy in a male-dominated society.

**Myrtle Wilson** represents the working-class woman who aspires to upward mobility through her relationship with Tom. She attempts to transcend her class position through her affair, buying expensive clothes and adopting sophisticated mannerisms. However, her attempts are ultimately pathetic and doomed—she remains trapped in her marriage to George and her life in the Valley of Ashes. Her violent death symbolizes the destructive consequences of crossing social boundaries.

**The novel suggests that despite appearances of greater freedom, women in the 1920s remained constrained** by societal expectations and economic dependence. The female characters are all defined by their relationships to men—Daisy as Tom's wife and Gatsby's lover, Jordan as Nick's love interest, and Myrtle as Tom's mistress. Their desires and ambitions are largely channeled through these relationships rather than pursued independently.

**Fitzgerald also critiques the objectification of women** throughout the novel. Female characters are frequently described in terms of their physical appearance, and their value seems to lie primarily in their beauty and ability to attract men. This objectification is perhaps most evident in Tom's treatment of both Daisy and Myrtle, whom he views as possessions rather than individuals with their own agency.

Through these portrayals, Fitzgerald presents a complex picture of womanhood in the 1920s—one that acknowledges some changes in social roles while emphasizing the persistent limitations and constraints faced by women of different classes.

## 8. How does Fitzgerald use setting to develop the novel's themes?

Fitzgerald masterfully uses setting in "The Great Gatsby" to develop the novel's themes, creating distinct geographical spaces that reflect and reinforce the moral, social, and psychological dimensions of the characters and their world.

**East Egg and West Egg** represent the social divisions between old money and new money. East Egg, with its "fashionable" white palaces, houses the established aristocracy like the Buchanans, who have inherited their wealth and social position. West Egg, with its "queer, glittering" houses, represents the newly rich like Gatsby, who have acquired their wealth through questionable means. This geographical division reinforces the theme of class stratification and the impossibility of crossing social boundaries, no matter how much wealth one acquires.

**The Valley of Ashes** serves as a powerful symbol of the moral and social decay hidden beneath the glamorous surface of wealth. This "desolate area of land" between West Egg and New York City represents the forgotten working class and the consequences of the wealthy's careless pursuit of pleasure. The valley, with its "ash-gray men" and "grotesque gardens," embodies the theme of the corruption of the American Dream and the moral emptiness that lies beneath the glittering surface of the Jazz Age.

**New York City** represents the moral chaos and excitement of modern urban life. It's where characters go to escape their problems and indulge in their desires—Tom meets Myrtle there, Nick has his first encounter with Jordan, and Gatsby's shady business dealings take place there. The city's fast-paced, anonymous environment facilitates the characters' immoral behavior and reinforces the theme of moral decay in modern society.

**The weather** serves as a symbolic setting element that reflects the emotional atmosphere of key scenes. The heat on the day of the confrontation between Gatsby and Tom creates a tense, oppressive atmosphere that mirrors the emotional intensity of the conflict. The rain that falls when Gatsby finally meets Daisy again symbolizes the awkwardness and emotional release of their reunion.

**Gatsby's mansion** serves as a microcosm of his character and dreams. Its extravagant but impersonal nature reflects Gatsby's attempt to buy status and happiness through material possessions. The mansion's transformation from a party venue to an empty house after Gatsby's death symbolizes the emptiness of his dream and the transient nature of his success.

Through these carefully crafted settings, Fitzgerald creates a rich symbolic landscape that reinforces the novel's themes of class division, the corruption of the American Dream, moral decay, and the impossibility of escaping the past. The settings are not merely backdrops but active participants in the story, shaping characters' actions and reflecting their inner lives.

## 9. Analyze the significance of the color symbolism in the novel.

Fitzgerald employs color symbolism throughout "The Great Gatsby" to enhance characterization, develop themes, and create a rich symbolic landscape that deepens the novel's meaning.

**White** appears frequently in descriptions of Daisy and Jordan, traditionally suggesting purity and innocence. However, Fitzgerald subverts this conventional meaning. When Nick first meets Daisy and Jordan, they are both dressed in white, their dresses "rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house." This image suggests both innocence and emptiness, as the women are as "buoyed up" as though upon an "anchored balloon." The white symbolizes their superficial charm and the illusion of purity that conceals their moral corruption and carelessness.

**Yellow** represents corruption, decay, and false wealth. Gatsby's car, which becomes the instrument of death, is yellow. The "yellow cocktail music" at his parties suggests the artificiality and corruption of his world. Yellow also appears in descriptions of Myrtle Wilson—her dress is "bright, cream-colored" when she first meets Tom, but later she buys "a small, expensive dog leash of leather with silver" that is yellow, symbolizing her false aspirations and the corruption of her dream of upward mobility.

**Green** is perhaps the most significant color symbol in the novel, representing hope, possibility, and the future. The green light at the end of Daisy's dock is the most prominent example, representing Gatsby's hopes and dreams for the future. Nick notes that "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us." Green also appears in the description of the "fresh, green breast of the new world" that the Dutch sailors first saw, connecting Gatsby's personal dream to the larger American Dream.

**Blue** represents melancholy, fantasy, and illusion. Gatsby's gardens are blue, his chauffeur wears blue, and his men's voices are "blue" when he's entertaining. The color suggests the dreamlike quality of Gatsby's world and the sadness underlying his quest. When Nick sees Gatsby standing alone in his blue garden, it emphasizes Gatsby's isolation and the melancholy nature of his pursuit.

**Gray** represents the lack of life, spirit, and hope, most prominently in the Valley of Ashes. The "ash-gray men" who live and work there are devoid of color and vitality, symbolizing the moral and spiritual decay of the working class and the consequences of the wealthy's careless pursuit of pleasure. The gray setting contrasts sharply with the colorful world of the Eggs, highlighting the class divisions in the novel.

**Pink** appears in Gatsby's suit, which is "pink" when he reunites with Daisy, suggesting his vulnerability and the artificiality of his attempt to recreate the past. The color also appears in the description of "the pink rag of a cloud" floating over the sea, symbolizing the fragile and transient nature of Gatsby's dreams.

Through this sophisticated use of color symbolism, Fitzgerald creates a rich symbolic tapestry that enhances characterization, develops themes, and deepens the novel's emotional and psychological resonance. The colors are not merely decorative but integral to the novel's meaning, providing visual cues that guide the reader's interpretation of characters and events.

## 10. Discuss the significance of the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg.

The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg on the billboard overlooking the Valley of Ashes serve as one of the most powerful and complex symbols in "The Great Gatsby," representing multiple layers of meaning that develop throughout the novel.

**As a symbol of the death of God and traditional values**, the eyes represent a modern world where religion has been replaced by commercialism. The billboard, advertising an oculist, features "blue and gigantic" eyes with spectacles that look out over "no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles." In a world that has lost its spiritual foundation, these commercial eyes have become a god-like presence, watching over the moral decay below. George Wilson's reference to them as "God's eyes" after Myrtle's death highlights this symbolic dimension.

**The eyes represent the moral judgment that the characters have abandoned**. As the novel progresses and the characters become increasingly immoral—engaging in affairs, lying, and ultimately causing deaths—the eyes continue to watch silently, serving as a constant reminder of the moral vacuum in which the characters operate. When George Wilson looks at the eyes before killing Gatsby, he mistakes them for the eyes of God, suggesting that in the absence of traditional moral authority, commercial images have taken on divine significance.

**The eyes symbolize the connection between the moral decay of the wealthy and the suffering of the poor**. Located in the Valley of Ashes, between the Eggs and New York, the eyes watch over both worlds but seem particularly focused on the desolation below. Their position suggests that the moral corruption of the wealthy directly impacts

# Why and How Fitzgerald Uses Symbols in "The Great Gatsby"

## Why Fitzgerald Uses Symbols

### 1. To Develop Complex Themes
- **American Dream**: Symbols like the green light represent the promise of the American Dream and its ultimate unattainability
- **Moral Decay**: The Valley of Ashes symbolizes the moral corruption beneath the glamorous surface
- **Illusion vs. Reality**: Symbols reveal the gap between appearance and truth in the characters' lives

### 2. To Create Emotional Impact
- Symbols evoke feelings that simple descriptions cannot convey
- They create a more immersive reading experience
- They allow readers to connect with abstract concepts through concrete images

### 3. To Enhance Social Commentary
- Symbols critique 1920s society without direct preaching
- They reveal the emptiness of materialism and social status
- They expose the class divisions and moral bankruptcy of the era

### 4. To Add Depth and Complexity
- Multiple layers of meaning make the novel richer
- Symbols invite different interpretations and readings
- They create connections between seemingly unrelated elements

## How Fitzgerald Uses Symbols

### 1. Through Recurring Motifs
- **The Green Light**:
  - First appears in Chapter 1 when Nick sees Gatsby reaching for it
  - Reappears throughout the novel, changing in significance
  - Finally represents both Gatsby's dream and the universal human struggle

- **The Eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg**:
  - Introduced as a faded billboard in the Valley of Ashes
  - Evolves to represent God's absence/presence in modern society
  - Becomes a witness to moral corruption and tragedy

### 2. Through Color Symbolism
- **White**: Initially suggests purity (Daisy's dresses), but reveals emptiness and moral vacuum
- **Yellow**: Represents corruption (Gatsby's car, cocktail music) and false value
- **Green**: Symbolizes hope (the light), money, and the promise of the future
- **Gray**: Conveys the lifelessness of the Valley of Ashes and moral decay

### 3. Through Setting as Symbol
- **East Egg vs. West Egg**: Represents the divide between old and new money
- **The Valley of Ashes**: Symbolizes the moral waste and social decay
- **New York City**: Represents the moral chaos and corruption of modern life

### 4. Through Objects and Actions
- **Automobiles**: Symbolize wealth, status, and danger/death
- **Gatsby's Mansion**: Represents his attempt to buy status and happiness
- **Parties**: Symbolize the emptiness of social gatherings without real connection
- **Weather**: Mirrors emotional states (rain during reunion, heat during confrontation)

### 5. Through Character Names and Attributes
- **Daisy**: Named after a flower—beautiful on the outside, with a yellow (corrupt) center
- **Jordan**: Named after a river suggesting flow and movement, but also boundaries
- **Nick**: A common name suggesting he represents the "everyman" observer

## Literary Technique Integration

### 1. Natural Integration
- Symbols emerge organically from the narrative rather than feeling forced
- Fitzgerald seamlessly incorporates symbols into descriptions and dialogue
- Characters interact with symbols naturally, making them part of the story world

### 2. Progressive Revelation
- Symbols gain complexity and meaning as the novel progresses
- Early appearances of symbols are simple, later ones more layered
- This evolution mirrors the reader's growing understanding of the novel

### 3. Interconnected Symbolism
- Symbols connect and reinforce each other throughout the novel
- The green light connects to the water, which connects to Gatsby's death in the pool
- The eyes of Dr. Eckleburg watch over the Valley of Ashes, connecting moral judgment to social decay

### 4. Ambiguity
- Fitzgerald maintains some ambiguity in his symbols, allowing multiple interpretations
- This complexity reflects the Modernist literary movement's emphasis on subjective experience
- It invites readers to participate in creating meaning rather than receiving a fixed message

## Conclusion

Fitzgerald's masterful use of symbols elevates "The Great Gatsby" from a simple story of love and betrayal to a profound meditation on American society, human desire, and the impossibility of recapturing the past. By weaving symbols throughout the narrative—through colors, objects, settings, and actions—he creates a rich tapestry of meaning that continues to resonate with readers nearly a century after the novel's publication.

The symbols function on multiple levels simultaneously: developing themes, revealing character, creating atmosphere, and delivering social commentary. This multi-dimensional use of symbolism is one of the key reasons why "The Great Gatsby" remains a cornerstone of American literature and continues to be studied and analyzed by students and scholars alike.
