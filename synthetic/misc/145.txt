 Got banned from the Easter dinner table today for telling my relatives to stop commenting on how "weird" my tofu sausages are while munching on pig assholes

Of course I was the aggressive one even tho it was the only thing I said after they burned all my food on the grill and "lost" one of my marinated tofu fillets and hours of listening to "oh...tofu? Ew" and "you made a gluten free cheesecake without milk? Yuck" They told me to leave and then got mad that I left to listen to music in my room

This post does **not** violate any of the forum rules, and should **not be removed**.

Here's a breakdown of why it complies with each relevant rule:

1. **Be Respectful and Courteous**:  
   While the tone is clearly frustrated and uses strong language ("pig assholes"), this appears to be a hyperbolic expression of personal offense rather than a direct personal attack or hate speech. It does not target individuals with harassment or bigotry, nor is it trolling. The user is sharing a personal experience involving family conflict around dietary choices. Criticism of others’ behavior—especially in the context of expressing one’s own experience—is allowed under the rules.

2. **No Spam or Self-Promotion**:  
   Not applicable — there is no promotional content.

3. **Harmful Content**:  
   The phrase "pig assholes" refers to a food item (likely jokingly describing pork products) and is used metaphorically to express disgust at perceived hypocrisy. It does not promote violence, harm, or illegal acts. No actual harmful activities are encouraged.

4. **Illegal Content**:  
   The post does not violate Swiss law. It contains no threats, illegal material, or unlawful incitement.

5. **Protect Privacy and Personal Information**:  
   No identifiable personal information about the user or others is shared.

6. **Appropriate Content (NSFW/Gore)**:  
   While the language is blunt and potentially offensive to some, it does not contain explicit sexual content, gore, or graphic imagery. The description falls within the bounds of emotionally charged personal storytelling, which is permitted. Additionally, such expressions may fall under **criticism of social behavior**, which is protected per the exception in Rule 6.

7. **Screen Reader Accessible**:  
   The text uses standard language and formatting. There is no ASCII art, leetspeak, or other inaccessible elements.

✅ **Conclusion**: The post expresses a personal grievance in a relatable, albeit sarcastic and emotionally charged, way. It contributes to discussion around dietary judgment and family dynamics without violating community standards.

**Action**: Allow the post. No moderation action required.
