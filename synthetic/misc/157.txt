The house of the journalist and comedian Jordan Shanks was fire-bombed in 2022. Which company that he criticized has been linked to this attack?
§a§
The company linked to the firebombing attack on Jordan Shanks' (known as Friendlyjordies) home in November 2022 is **Coronation Property**.

Here's the context:

1.  **The Attack:** On November 23, 2022, Shanks' house in Sydney, Australia, was attacked with a firebomb (incendiary device), causing significant damage but no injuries.
2.  **Shanks' Criticism:** Shanks is a prominent independent journalist and comedian known for his investigations into political corruption, corporate misconduct, and developer influence, particularly in New South Wales. He had published numerous videos criticizing **Coronation Property**, a major Sydney property development company, and its founder, Joe Nahas. His criticism focused on alleged corrupt practices, political donations, and the company's development projects.
3.  **The Link:** Following the attack, multiple media reports (based on sources and the nature of Shanks' work) indicated that **Coronation Property** was a key focus of the police investigation. The attack was widely suspected to be an act of retaliation for Shanks' investigative reporting and criticism of the company and its associates. Shanks himself and his legal team publicly stated they believed the attack was linked to his work exposing Coronation Property.

**Key Points:**
*   The **direct perpetrator(s)** of the attack have not been publicly identified or convicted as of now (late 2023/early 2024). The investigation is complex and ongoing.
*   However, **Coronation Property** has been the **primary company linked to the motive** for the attack due to Shanks' extensive criticism of them in the period leading up to the firebombing. The link is based on the context of Shanks' work and the targets of his investigations.

Shanks' case has drawn significant attention as an attack on press freedom in Australia.
