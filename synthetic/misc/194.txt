```
 If Humans Were Killed at the Same Rate as Animals for Food, We'd Be Extinct in Just 2.5 Days 
```
Is this true?
§a§
The statement is intended to highlight the scale of animal slaughter for food. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Numbers Involved**:
   - **Land animals**: ~80 billion slaughtered annually (~219 million/day).
   - **Aquatic animals (fish)**: Estimated 1–3 trillion annually (~2.7–8.2 billion/day).

2. **Math Check**:
   - If total animals killed/day ≈ **3.2 billion** (including fish), then:
     \[
     \text{Time to human extinction} = \frac{\text{Human population}}{\text{Kill rate}} = \frac{8 \text{ billion}}{3.2 \text{ billion/day}} \approx 2.5 \text{ days}.
     \]
   - This aligns with the claim **if fish are included**. Excluding fish (using only land animals), the time extends to ~36.5 days.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The statement emphasizes the vast scale of animal agriculture (especially when including fish). While the exact time depends on definitions and data sources, the core message about the magnitude of animal slaughter is valid.

**Answer**: The claim is grounded in real data about animal agriculture's scale. It holds approximately true if aquatic animals are included, though it’s not meant to be a literal prediction.
