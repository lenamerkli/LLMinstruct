Who coined the term Vystopia?
§a§
The term **Vystopia** was coined by **Clare Mann**, an Australian psychologist, author, and vegan communications specialist.

She first introduced the term in 2017 to describe the specific mental and emotional distress experienced by vegans. She later detailed the concept in her 2018 book, *Vystopia: The Anguish of Being Vegan in a Non-Vegan World*.

Mann defines Vystopia as:
> The existential crisis experienced by vegans, arising from an awareness of the systemic exploitation and slaughter of animals, coupled with the realization that the rest of the world is largely indifferent to this reality.

The word is a portmanteau of **"vegan"** and **"dystopia,"** reflecting the feeling that one is living in a dystopian nightmare while those around them remain unaware or unconcerned.
