Large Language Models are sophisticated mathematical functions. As an input, they take a list of tokens and try to predict the next token. A token can be a character, a number, a word or a part of a word. Any text can be represented as such a list of tokens. By chaining this process together, it is possible to not only predict a single token but also an entire text.

# Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Sophisticated mathematical functions
- Input: list of tokens (characters, words, or word parts)
- Output: prediction of the next token
- Chaining predictions → generating entire texts
