# Setting Up a New Angular Project

Setting up a new Angular project is straightforward with the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface). Here's a comprehensive guide to get you started with your Angular development.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an Angular project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** - Version 20.19.0 or newer
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) - Included with Node.js
- **Text Editor** - Visual Studio Code is recommended
- **Terminal** - Required for running Angular CLI commands

You can verify your Node.js and npm installation by running:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Installing Angular CLI

The Angular CLI is a powerful tool that simplifies creating and managing Angular projects. Install it globally using your preferred package manager:

### Using npm:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Alternative package managers:
- **pnpm**: `pnpm install -g @angular/cli`
- **yarn**: `yarn global add @angular/cli`
- **bun**: `bun install -g @angular/cli`

After installation, verify the Angular CLI is properly installed:
```bash
ng version
```

## Creating a New Angular Project

Once the CLI is installed, creating a new project is simple:

1. **Navigate to your desired directory** where you want to create the project

2. **Run the new project command**:
```bash
ng new my-angular-app
```
Replace `my-angular-app` with your desired project name.

3. **Configure your project preferences**. The CLI will prompt you with several configuration options:
   - **Stylesheet format** (CSS, SCSS, Sass, Less)
   - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and Static Site Generation options
   - Other routing and testing preferences

   If you don't have specific preferences, press Enter to accept the defaults.

4. **Wait for installation**. The CLI will create the project structure and install all necessary dependencies. You'll see a success message:
```
✔ Packages installed successfully.
Successfully initialized git.
```



## Running Your Angular Application

After project creation, you can start the development server:

1. **Navigate to your project folder**:
```bash
cd my-angular-app
```

2. **Start the development server** using one of these commands:
```bash
ng serve
```
or
```bash
npm start
```

3. **Access your application**. Once the build completes, you'll see:
```
➜ Local: http://localhost:4200/
➜ press h + enter to show help
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see your running Angular application.

## Project Structure Overview

Your new Angular project will have the following key directories and files:

### Main Directories:
- **src/** - Contains all application source code
- **src/app/** - Main application components and logic
  - `app.component.ts` - Main component controlling the display
  - `app.component.html` - HTML template for the main component
  - `app.component.css/scss` - Styles for the main component
  - `app.routes.ts` - Application routing configuration

### Configuration Files:
- **package.json** - Lists all project dependencies and scripts
- **angular.json** - Angular CLI configuration for build, test, and serve commands
- **src/index.html** - Main HTML file that loads the application
- **src/main.ts** - Application entry point that bootstraps the Angular app

## Useful Angular CLI Commands

Once your project is set up, these commands will help you develop your application:

### Generate new components:
```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

### Generate services:
```bash
ng generate service service-name
```

### Generate directives:
```bash
ng generate directive directive-name
```

### Build for production:
```bash
ng build
```

## Alternative Setup Methods

### Visual Studio Integration
If you're using Visual Studio 2022 or later, you can create an Angular project directly from the IDE:
1. Select **Create a new project** from the Start window
2. Search for "Angular" and select **Angular App**
3. Name your project and click **Create**

### Online Development
For quick experimentation without local setup, Angular provides online sandboxes where you can code directly in your browser.

## Next Steps

After successfully setting up your Angular project, you can:
- Start building components for your application features
- Configure routing for multi-page navigation
- Add Angular Material for UI components
- Integrate with backend APIs
- Set up testing frameworks

Your Angular development environment is now ready, and you can begin building your web application with all the powerful features Angular provides.
