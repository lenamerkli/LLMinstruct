From which country is this statistic?
§a§
This is a list of the **most common surnames in Switzerland**.

Key clues:

1. **German-language surnames** like Müller, Meier, Schmid, Keller, Weber, Schneider, Huber, Meyer, Steiner — all very common in German-speaking Switzerland.
2. **Spelling variants** like “Schmid” (common Swiss German spelling, rather than German “Schmidt”).
3. **Presence of “da Silva”** — reflects immigration from Portugal to Switzerland in recent decades, which is a notable feature of Swiss surname statistics.
4. The ranking and numbers match known Swiss federal surname statistics (published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office).

So the answer is **Switzerland**.
