 **Golden Hamster Mornay in Phyllo Cups**
*A delicate fusion of crisp phyllo, rich cheese sauce, and tender hamster medallions, infused with aromatic herbs.*

**Ingredients** (Serves 4):
- 1 package phyllo cups (or small tart shells)
- 200g hamster meat, diced into small cubes
- 1 cup béchamel sauce (made with milk, butter, flour)
- 1 cup grated Gruyère cheese
- 1 tsp saffron threads (steeped in 2 tbsp warm milk)
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves
- 1 lemon-zested (for brightness)
- Pinch of nutmeg
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: 1 tsp truffle oil (for drizzle)

**Instructions**:
1. **Prep the phyllo cups**: Follow package instructions to bake or brush with melted butter until golden and crisp. Set aside.
2. **Sauté the hamster**: In a pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Season hamster cubes with salt, pepper, and thyme. Cook until golden and tender (about 3-4 minutes). Set aside.
3. **Make the mornay sauce**: In a saucepan, prepare béchamel by melting butter, whisking in flour, and slowly adding milk until thickened. Stir in Gruyère, saffron milk, nutmeg, and lemon zest. Simmer until creamy.
4. **Assemble**: Divide the cooked hamster among the phyllo cups. Pour the mornay sauce over each portion, ensuring it bubbles slightly.
5. **Garnish and serve**: Drizzle with truffle oil (if using) and a dusting of paprika or parsley. Serve warm with a side of crisp salad.
