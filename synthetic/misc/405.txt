§a§
The error message indicates that your system is missing the **cURL development libraries**, which are required to build the HTTP model download feature of the project (likely `llama.cpp`).

You have two options to fix this:

### Option 1: Install the missing dependency (Recommended)
You need to install the development headers for libcurl. Run the command corresponding to your Linux distribution:

**Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

**Arch Linux / Manjaro (Likely given GCC 15.2):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S curl
```

**Fedora / RHEL / CentOS:**
```bash
sudo dnf install libcurl-devel
```

**OpenSUSE:**
```bash
sudo zypper install libcurl-devel
```

After installing, run your build command again:
```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON
```

---

### Option 2: Disable the feature
If you do not need the capability to download models directly via the executable, you can disable the dependency as suggested by the error hint.

Add `-DLLAMA_CURL=OFF` to your CMake command:

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DLLAMA_CURL=OFF
```
