Why is there no train connection between Huttwil and Sumiswald-Grünen even though there are tracks between these places?
§a§
**There is no regular, scheduled passenger train service (e.g., in the SBB timetable) between Huttwil and Sumiswald-Grünen, despite the tracks still existing and being maintained.**

The approximately 13 km single-track section is part of the historic Ramsei–Huttwil railway line (opened 1908), which has long suffered from low ridership due to sparse population in the Emmental region and chronic financial losses. Regular through passenger services to Huttwil ended on December 11, 2004, and were replaced by buses (e.g., from Affoltern im Emmental to Huttwil). Operations fully ceased from 2009–2014 due to unsafe, outdated 1940s-era overhead lines.

In 2013, the Emmentalbahn GmbH (ETB), founded by the Museumsbahn Emmental cooperative, took over the infrastructure concession to preserve the tracks and enable occasional freight, test runs (e.g., Léman Express), and heritage operations—supported by federal and cantonal subsidies. The line reopened for electric traffic in 2015 and steam excursions in 2017.

**Today, trains run only as a seasonal heritage/tourist service by the Museumsbahn Emmental (using historic steam and electric locos), not as everyday public transport.** As of December 2025, there are no services—no daily or even weekly trains. Operations are limited to select dates: typically the 2nd Sunday monthly from April–October (e.g., April 21, May 11, etc., in 2025), special events like markets or jubilees (e.g., 150 years Emmentalbahn on May 17/18, 2025), and a winter steam run in February. A historic post bus supplements some runs May–October.

The S44 regional train (BLS) serves only up to Sumiswald-Grünen from Burgdorf/Bern/Thun, with no extension to Huttwil. For regular travel, use buses or connections via Langnau i.E. or Burgdorf. Check emmentalbahn.ch for exact heritage dates and tickets (e.g., Huttwil–Sumiswald return ~CHF 35).
