What is this regex for?
§a§
This regex:

```regex
\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+\b
```

is designed to match **multi-word capitalized phrases**, typically things like personal names or proper nouns made of two or more words.

Breakdown:

- `\b` – word boundary (start of a word).
- `[A-Z][a-z]+` – a capital letter followed by one or more lowercase letters
  → matches a single “Capitalized” word (e.g., `John`, `London`).
- `(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+` – a non-capturing group, repeated one or more times:
  - `\s+` – one or more whitespace characters (space, tab, etc.).
  - `[A-Z][a-z]+` – another capitalized word.
  → means **at least one more** capitalized word separated by whitespace.
- `\b` – word boundary (end of the last word).

So overall, it matches **two or more consecutive capitalized words**, such as:

- `John Smith`
- `New York`
- `San Francisco Bay`
- `The Beatles` (only if “The” is capitalized and the next word is too)

It does **not** match:

- Single words like `John`
- All-caps words like `NASA`
- Words with internal punctuation like `O'Neill` or `Smith-Jones`
- Names with lowercase interior words like `University of Texas` (because `of` is lowercase)
