# Explanation of `self.q_table = defaultdict(lambda: np.zeros(9))`

This line creates a **Q-table** for the Q-learning algorithm. Here's what each part does:

## Breaking it down:

1. **`defaultdict`** - A special dictionary that automatically creates entries for keys that don't exist yet

2. **`lambda: np.zeros(9)`** - An anonymous function that returns a numpy array of 9 zeros: `[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]`

3. **Combined effect**: When you access `self.q_table[some_state]` for a state that hasn't been seen before, instead of getting a `KeyError`, it automatically creates that entry with a fresh array of 9 zeros.

## Practical example:

```python
# First time accessing a new state
state = "X..O....."
q_values = self.q_table[state]
# Automatically creates: state -> [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

# Now you can update individual actions
self.q_table[state][3] = 0.5  # Update Q-value for action 3
```

## Why 9 zeros?

The 9 corresponds to the **9 possible actions** (board positions 0-8 in a Tic-Tac-Toe game), where each value represents the expected reward (Q-value) for taking that action from the given state.
