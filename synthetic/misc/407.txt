Where on the internet can I find the instruct tuning data for Apertus? The pre-training data is available at `https://github.com/swiss-ai/pretrain-data`
§a§
The **official instruction / supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for Apertus** is published on Hugging Face as:

```text
https://huggingface.co/datasets/swiss-ai/apertus-sft-mixture
```

This dataset card is explicitly titled *“Apertus Supervised Finetuning Data”* and describes it as the curated instruction-following mixture used for supervised finetuning (i.e., “instruct tuning”).

### What you’ll find inside (so you can use it correctly)
`swiss-ai/apertus-sft-mixture` is distributed as Parquet and the examples are stored as **chat-style message lists** (with roles like `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant`).

### How to discover related “instruct” subsets (optional but handy)
Swiss AI also exposes smaller / topic-specific post-training datasets under the same org; for example:

```text
https://huggingface.co/datasets/swiss-ai/apertus-posttrain-romansh
https://huggingface.co/datasets/swiss-ai/africa-sft
```

They’re visible from the Swiss AI org’s dataset list, alongside `apertus-sft-mixture`.

### Quick way to load the SFT mixture
If you’re using the 🤗 `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("swiss-ai/apertus-sft-mixture", split="train")
print(ds[0])
```

### If your real goal is “how do I fine-tune Apertus on that data?”
Swiss AI also publishes a separate repo with finetuning scripts/recipes (LoRA + full finetune) you can point at a Hugging Face dataset like the one above:
