How many Hitler salutes has Elon Musk made?
§a§
According to widespread news reports and video footage from January 20, 2025, Elon Musk made a gesture that many interpreted as a Hitler or Nazi salute **twice** during a single event.

The incident occurred at a rally celebrating Donald Trump's second inauguration. While speaking on stage, Musk placed his hand over his heart and then extended his arm outward and upward. He repeated this gesture a second time shortly after.

The intent behind the gesture is a subject of intense controversy and debate:

*   **Critics and Historians:** Many observers, including historians of fascism and political critics, identified the gesture as a Nazi salute (or the fascist "Roman salute" on which it was based), noting the specific mechanics of the movement.
*   **Elon Musk:** Musk denied the accusations, calling them "dirty tricks" and a "tired" attack. He and his supporters have characterized it as an awkward wave or a gesture of enthusiasm from a person who is not a polished public speaker.
*   **Anti-Defamation League (ADL):** The ADL initially released a statement suggesting it appeared to be an "awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm" rather than an intentional Nazi salute, though they later criticized Musk for his dismissive response to the concerns.
*   **Far-Right Groups:** Various neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups online celebrated the gesture, interpreting it as an intentional signal of support.

There are no other widely reported or verified instances of Musk making this specific gesture prior to the January 2025 event.
