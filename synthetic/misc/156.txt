Elon Musk attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, and delivered a speech at a post-inauguration celebration rally at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. Trump had designated Musk to co-head the "Department of Government Efficiency," an outside commission aimed at identifying federal programs and spending to cut

During his speech, Musk thanked the crowd for voting for Trump, stating "this was no ordinary victory" and "a fork in the road of human civilization" He jumped onto the stage and began dancing before transitioning into his remarks

## The Controversial Gesture

The most significant and controversial moment occurred when Musk placed his hand on his chest and then extended his arm outward above his head with his palm facing down in a straight-arm gesture He performed this gesture twice—once facing the audience in front of him and again after turning to face the audience behind the podium Following these gestures, he said "My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured"

The gesture was widely interpreted as resembling a Nazi salute or fascist Roman salute, sparking immediate controversy Many observers noted the similarity to the "Sieg Heil" used by Nazis at their victory rallies The phrase "my heart goes out to you" typically expresses "sorrow or sympathy" rather than thanks, adding to the confusion surrounding the moment

## Reactions and Controversy

The gesture generated sharply divided reactions along partisan lines. Several academics with expertise on extremism described it as a Nazi salute Jewish Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler called the gesture antisemitic, while progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned it and implied Musk was "sympathetic to Nazis" Minnesota governor Tim Walz stated it was "of course" a Nazi salute, prompting Musk to say he would consider suing Walz for the statement

The gesture was particularly condemned in Germany, where making such gestures is illegal The Southern Poverty Law Center referred to it as an "apparent Nazi salute" and noted that many far-right figures celebrated it as a Roman salute The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention issued a red flag alert for genocide in the United States in response

However, the Anti-Defamation League defended Musk, characterizing it as an "awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm" rather than a Nazi salute Republican politicians including Ted Cruz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Elise Stefanik defended Musk, with Cruz stating that Musk "literally said 'my heart goes out to you' as he made the gesture from his heart to the people" Conservative strategist Scott Jennings dismissed critics as suffering from "Trump derangement syndrome"

Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups celebrated the gesture as a Nazi salute Multiple European political parties demanded that Musk be banned from entering their countries Musk's estranged daughter Vivian Wilson also criticized the gesture on social media

Musk dismissed the accusations of Nazi sympathies, deriding them as "dirty tricks" and a "tired" attack Many major subreddits on Reddit instituted new rules banning links to or screenshots of X posts in response to the controversy

## Speech Content

Beyond the controversial gesture, Musk's speech focused on several themes. He promised that Trump's administration would deliver "safe cities, secure borders, sensible spending, basic stuff" He expressed enthusiasm about space exploration, stating "we're gonna take Doge to Mars" and asking the crowd to imagine "how awesome it will be to have American astronauts plant the flag on another planet for the first time"

Musk emphasized optimism as a core American value, telling the crowd "one of the most American values that I love is optimism" and expressing excitement about making "the future good" He concluded by telling the audience "I love you guys" and promising "I'm gonna work my ass off for you guys"

The incident was subsequently parodied on *Saturday Night Live*, with cast members James Austin Johnson and Michael Che lampooning the moment.
