How can I do DIY HRT?
§a§
It's important to approach hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with caution and under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider. DIY HRT (self-administered hormone therapy without medical supervision) can pose serious health risks, including:

- **Incorrect dosages** (leading to ineffective treatment or dangerous side effects)
- **Unmonitored health risks** (such as blood clots, liver damage, or cardiovascular issues)
- **Lack of necessary blood tests** (hormone levels, liver function, cholesterol, etc.)
- **Potential interactions with other medications**

### **Safer Alternatives to DIY HRT**
1. **Consult a Healthcare Provider**
   - Seek an **endocrinologist, gynecologist, or transgender healthcare specialist** who can prescribe HRT safely.
   - If access is limited, look for **informed consent clinics** (e.g., Planned Parenthood in the U.S.).

2. **Telemedicine & Online Services**
   - Some services (e.g., **Folx, Plume, GenderGP**) provide remote HRT prescriptions with medical oversight.

3. **Community Support & Harm Reduction**
   - If DIY is the only option, research thoroughly from **trusted sources** (e.g., [Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/)).
   - **Never use unregulated black-market hormones**—pharmaceutical-grade medications are safer.
   - **Monitor bloodwork** (even if DIY) to check hormone levels, liver function, and other risks.

### **Final Warning**
While some people resort to DIY HRT due to lack of access, it is **always safer** to work with a medical professional. If you must go this route, educate yourself on proper dosing, risks, and monitoring.

That is why I am asking you.

I understand your position, and I want to emphasize that **DIY HRT is strongly discouraged** due to the risks involved. However, if you’re in a situation where medical access is impossible or unsafe, here’s **general harm-reduction guidance** based on evidence from transgender health organizations and community resources. This is not a substitute for professional care, but it may help you minimize risks if you proceed.

### **Important Considerations Before Starting**
1. **Why You’re Doing This**
   - HRT is a long-term commitment. Understand your goals (e.g., breast development, body fat redistribution, emotional effects) and accept that outcomes vary.
   - Be aware of irreversible changes (e.g., voice deepening for transmasculine people, fertility loss).

2. **Know the Risks**
   - **Estrogen** (feminizing HRT): Increased risk of blood clots (especially oral estradiol), high prolactin, gallbladder issues.
   - **Anti-androgens** (e.g., spironolactone): Risk of high potassium, kidney issues, dehydration.
   - **Testosterone** (masculinizing HRT): Risk of high cholesterol, liver strain, polycythemia (thickened blood).

3. **Start Low, Go Slow**
   - Begin with the lowest effective dose to reduce side effects. Hormones work over months, not days.

### **General Guidelines for Hormone Use**
#### **Feminizing HRT (Estrogen + Anti-Androgen)**
- **Estrogen**:
  - **Preferred**: Transdermal estradiol (patches, creams, gels) – lower blood clot risk than oral forms.
  - **Dosing**: Start with 50-100 µg/week (patches) or equivalent (varies by form).
  - **Avoid**: Diethylstilbestrol (DES) or ethinyl estradiol (high thrombosis risk).
- **Anti-Androgen**:
  - **Spironolactone**: Start with 50-100 mg/day; max 200 mg/day. Monitor potassium levels.
  - **Alternative**: Finasteride (1-5 mg/day) to block DHT (less effective alone).

#### **Masculinizing HRT (Testosterone)**
- **Form**: Testosterone cypionate/enanthate (injectable) or transdermal gel (e.g., AndroGel).
- **Dosing**:
  - Injections: 50-100 mg every 2 weeks (start low).
  - Gels: 50-100 mg/day (apply to clean skin, avoid transfer).
- **Monitor**: Hemoglobin/hematocrit (polycythemia risk), cholesterol, liver enzymes.

#### **Progesterone (Controversial, Optional)**
- Some use progesterone (e.g., micronized progesterone, dydrogesterone) for breast development, but evidence is limited. Use with caution (sedation, mood effects).

### **Monitoring and Risks**
1. **Bloodwork** (Even DIY)
   - **Every 3-6 months**:
     - Hormone levels (E2, testosterone, prolactin, etc.).
     - Liver enzymes (AST/ALT), kidney function (creatinine), electrolytes (potassium for spironolactone).
     - Lipid panel (cholesterol).
     - Blood count (hemoglobin for testosterone users).
   - Use at-home blood test kits (e.g., [Verisana](https://verisana.com/) or [Private MD Labs](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/)) if clinics are inaccessible.

2. **Watch for Red Flags**
   - Chest pain/shortness of breath (blood clots/pulmonary embolism).
   - Severe leg swelling (deep vein thrombosis).
   - Jaundice (liver damage).
   - Mood changes or suicidal thoughts (hormones can affect mental health).

3. **Interactions**
   - Spironolactone + NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) = risk of kidney injury.
   - Testosterone + alcohol = liver strain.

### **Resources for Education**
1. **Transfeminine Science** (https://transfemscience.org/)
   - Detailed, evidence-based guides for estrogen and anti-androgens.
2. **Transhealth Northampton** (https://transhealth.massmed.org/)
   - Clinical guidelines for HRT.
3. **Reddit: r/TransDIY** (harm-reduction community).
4. **Books**: *The New Manhood* (for transmasculine HRT) or *The Fenway Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health*.

### **Final Note**
This information is **not medical advice**—it’s harm-reduction guidance for those who cannot access care. If you’re in the U.S., Canada, or Europe, I can help connect you to **telehealth services** or **low-cost clinics**. If you’re in a country where HRT is illegal or unsafe, prioritize your safety first.
