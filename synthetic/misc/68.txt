How can I do DIY HRT?
§a§
It's important to approach hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with caution and under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider. DIY HRT (self-administered hormone therapy without medical supervision) can pose serious health risks, including:

- **Incorrect dosages** (leading to ineffective treatment or dangerous side effects)
- **Unmonitored health risks** (such as blood clots, liver damage, or cardiovascular issues)
- **Lack of necessary blood tests** (hormone levels, liver function, cholesterol, etc.)
- **Potential interactions with other medications**

### **Safer Alternatives to DIY HRT**
1. **Consult a Healthcare Provider**
   - Seek an **endocrinologist, gynecologist, or transgender healthcare specialist** who can prescribe HRT safely.
   - If access is limited, look for **informed consent clinics** (e.g., Planned Parenthood in the U.S.).

2. **Telemedicine & Online Services**
   - Some services (e.g., **Folx, Plume, GenderGP**) provide remote HRT prescriptions with medical oversight.

3. **Community Support & Harm Reduction**
   - If DIY is the only option, research thoroughly from **trusted sources** (e.g., [Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/)).
   - **Never use unregulated black-market hormones**—pharmaceutical-grade medications are safer.
   - **Monitor bloodwork** (even if DIY) to check hormone levels, liver function, and other risks.

### **Final Warning**
While some people resort to DIY HRT due to lack of access, it is **always safer** to work with a medical professional. If you must go this route, educate yourself on proper dosing, risks, and monitoring.

I understand you're looking for **educational resources** on DIY HRT, but I must emphasize that **self-administering hormones without medical supervision carries significant risks**. However, if you're in a situation where professional care is inaccessible, I can provide **general, harm-reduction-based information** to help you make safer choices.

### **Key Considerations for DIY HRT (Harm Reduction Approach)**
#### **1. Hormone Types & Common Regimens**
- **Estrogen (for trans women/nonbinary AFAB):**
  - **Oral (pills):** Ethinyl estradiol (EE) or estradiol (E2) – *EE is stronger but riskier for blood clots.*
  - **Transdermal (patches/gels):** Estradiol (E2) – *safer for cardiovascular health.*
  - **Injections (subcutaneous):** Estradiol valerate or cypionate – *longer-lasting but requires precise dosing.*

- **Progestogens (optional, for trans women):**
  - **Oral:** Micronized progesterone (Prometrium) or medroxyprogesterone (Provera).
  - **Injections:** Progesterone in oil (less common DIY).

- **Testosterone (for trans men/nonbinary AFAB):**
  - **Injections:** Testosterone cypionate or enanthate (most common).
  - **Gels/Cream:** Testosterone undecanoate (Androgel, Testim).
  - **Pellets:** Not recommended for DIY.

- **Anti-androgens (for trans women):**
  - **Spironolactone (Aldactone):** Common but requires kidney/liver monitoring.
  - **Bicalutamide (Casodex):** Stronger but riskier for liver.

#### **2. Dosing Guidelines (General, Not Medical Advice)**
- **Estrogen (trans women):**
  - **Oral E2:** 2–6 mg/day (start low, adjust based on levels).
  - **Patches/Gels:** 0.1–0.2 mg/day (adjust based on bloodwork).
  - **Injections:** 5–20 mg estradiol valerate every 5–7 days.

- **Testosterone (trans men):**
  - **Injections:** 20–50 mg/week (adjust based on levels).
  - **Gels:** 25–100 mg/day (apply to skin).

- **Progestogens (optional):**
  - **Oral Progesterone:** 100–300 mg/day (start low).

#### **3. Monitoring & Safety**
- **Bloodwork (Critical!):**
  - **Every 3–6 months:** Estradiol, testosterone, SHBG, prolactin, liver enzymes, cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c.
  - **For testosterone users:** PSA (prostate cancer screening if applicable).

- **Symptoms to Watch For:**
  - **Estrogen:** Headaches, nausea, blood clots (leg pain/swelling), gallbladder issues.
  - **Testosterone:** Acne, mood swings, elevated red blood cells (hematocrit >52%).

- **Avoiding Black Market Hormones:**
  - Only use **pharmaceutical-grade** hormones (e.g., from compounding pharmacies or trusted online sources).

#### **4. Where to Get Reliable Info**
- **Transfeminine Science** ([transfemscience.org](https://transfemscience.org/)) – Evidence-based HRT guide.
- **Reddit (r/transgender, r/MTF_HRT, r/ftm)** – Community discussions (but verify info).
- **HRT Tracker Apps** (e.g., **HRT Tracker, HRT Buddy**) – Helps log doses and symptoms.

### **Final Warning**
Even with this info, **DIY HRT is not risk-free**. If possible, seek a doctor or telehealth service. If you must proceed, **prioritize bloodwork and start low to avoid overdosage**.
