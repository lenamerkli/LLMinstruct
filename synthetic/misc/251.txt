Is Nicolas Guillou still able to use Microsoft Windows?
§a§
Key points:

- Since **20 August 2025** Nicolas Guillou has been placed on the U.S. OFAC sanctions (SDN) list. Under those sanctions, **any U.S. person or company, including their foreign subsidiaries, is forbidden to provide him with goods or services**.   
- Analyses of these sanctions note that this **includes digital services from U.S. tech firms such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.**   
- In the ICC context, reports say the chief prosecutor Karim Khan **lost access to Microsoft services**, and that several other ICC officials, including Nicolas Guillou, experienced similar cut‑offs from Microsoft’s applications and cloud services after sanctions.   

So, in practical terms:

- **He is not supposed to be able to receive any Microsoft services in his own name** (buying Windows, activating new licenses, using Microsoft 365, getting support, etc.), because Microsoft is legally barred from serving him.  
- **There is no public information** that says his existing, already‑activated copy of Windows on a personal PC has been remotely disabled. Technically, an offline or already‑licensed Windows installation would continue to boot; what he loses is the *relationship with Microsoft* (accounts, purchases, updates, cloud features), not physical access to his computer.

Because his personal devices and software choices are private, we **cannot say with certainty** what operating system he runs at home today. All we can safely infer from the sanctions and reporting is:

- **Normal, legitimate use of Microsoft Windows as a paid, supported product from Microsoft is effectively blocked for him.**  
- Any continued use would have to rely on installations and licenses obtained before sanctions (and likely with reduced or no access to updates and online features).
