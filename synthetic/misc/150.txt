Cows are highly intelligent and deeply sentient and emotional beings with distinct individual personalities. Each and every individual has a unique personality, and it’s fair to say not a single cow enjoys being farmed for human meals. 
```
Is this true?
§a§
That’s an excellent question—and it gets at the intersection of animal cognition, emotion, and ethics, all topics that are richer than they might appear from a distance.  

Let’s unpack the statement piece by piece:  

### 1. **Intelligence**
Scientific studies do show that cows have notable cognitive abilities. They can:
- **Learn complex tasks and remember solutions** for months. For example, cows in problem-solving experiments have been observed showing signs of excitement or satisfaction upon success—tail wagging and energetic movement.
- **Recognize faces**—both bovine and human—over long periods.
- **Develop social hierarchies** and remember different individuals’ social status and behavior.  

So “highly intelligent” is fair in the sense that cows have advanced learning and memory skills often underestimated by people. They’re not on par with problem-solving corvids (like crows) or primates, but they are much more cognitively sophisticated than once thought.

### 2. **Sentience and Emotion**
There’s solid evidence that cows are sentient—they experience pain, stress, comfort, and pleasure.  
- Physiological measures (like cortisol levels) show that they experience **fear and anxiety** in stressful conditions such as transport or separation.
- They form **emotional bonds**, especially between mothers and calves.
- They show signs of **empathy**—for instance, their heart rates and behaviors change when they see another cow in distress.

So yes, they meet the scientific definition of sentience: the capacity to feel.

### 3. **Individual Personalities**
Behavioral research consistently finds that cows display stable personality traits—some are bolder, some shy, some more inquisitive. Farmers and animal behaviorists can identify cows by personality as reliably as by physical markings. So it’s accurate to say each cow is an individual.

### 4. **Enjoyment of Being Farmed**
This part moves from empirical observation to ethical inference.  
We can infer from behavior that cows **avoid situations associated with discomfort, fear, or pain**. Industrial farming and slaughter involve many such experiences, so it is reasonable to conclude that they **do not “enjoy”** those conditions. However, it’s harder to generalize “not a single cow enjoys being farmed” because “enjoyment” implies human-like reflective awareness that we can’t directly measure. What we *can* say is that the conditions of farming typically cause stress and fear, so enjoyment would be extremely unlikely.

### Putting it together  
The statement captures the **spirit** of current animal-behavior science—acknowledging cows as thinking, feeling individuals—but it uses slightly emotional language where scientists would speak in terms of *sentience, affect, and aversive stimuli*.  

So: mostly true in essence, though not stated in the neutral phrasing scientists prefer.  

(If cows could read laboratory reports, they’d probably nod solemnly and then go back to eating grass, unimpressed by our terminology.)
