Here's a straightforward comparison of the two graphics feature sets:

## Key Differences

| Feature | Set 1 | Set 2 | Winner |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| **DirectX** | 12 Ultimate (12_2) | 12 (12_1) | **Set 1** |
| **CUDA** | 8.6 | 7.0 | **Set 1** |
| **OpenGL** | 4.6 | 4.6 | Tie |
| **OpenCL** | 3.0 | 3.0 | Tie |
| **Vulkan** | 1.4 | 1.4 | Tie |
| **Shader Model** | 6.8 | 6.8 | Tie |

## What This Means

**DirectX 12 Ultimate vs 12_1:**
- Set 1 supports **ray tracing (DXR)**, mesh shaders, variable rate shading, and sampler feedback
- Set 2 lacks these modern graphics features
- **Practical impact**: Set 1 can run cutting-edge games with ray tracing and improved performance; Set 2 cannot

**CUDA 8.6 vs 7.0:**
- Set 1 uses **Ampere architecture** (RTX 30-series era) with newer tensor cores and compute capabilities
- Set 2 uses **Maxwell architecture** (GTX 900-series era)
- **Practical impact**: Set 1 offers significantly better performance in AI/ML workloads, creative apps, and GPU computing

## Bottom Line
**Set 1 is clearly superior** - it's a newer-generation GPU with full ray tracing support and modern compute capabilities. The identical OpenGL/Vulkan/Shader Model versions just mean both support the same baseline API standards, but Set 1's hardware can do more with them.

The first one is a RTX 3090 and the second one V100-32GB. What should I choose for LLMs? Both have the same bandwith and the V100 is only half the price.

Based on your use case for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, here's a detailed comparison between the **RTX 3090** and **V100-32GB**, considering your budget and technical requirements:

### **Key Specifications for LLMs**
| **Feature**               | **RTX 3090**                     | **V100-32GB**                   | **Winner for LLMs**       |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **VRAM**                  | 24 GB                            | **32 GB**                       | **V100** (critical for large models) |
| **Memory Bandwidth**      | 936 GB/s                         | 900 GB/s                        | Tie (negligible difference) |
| **Tensor Cores**          | Ampere (3rd gen)                 | Volta (2nd gen)                 | **RTX 3090** (faster AI/ML) |
| **CUDA Compute Capability**| 8.6                              | 7.0                             | **RTX 3090** (newer features) |
| **FP16/BF16 Performance**  | ~312 TFLOPS                      | ~112 TFLOPS                     | **RTX 3090** (2.8x faster) |
| **Price**                 | ~$1,500                          | ~$750                           | **V100** (50% cheaper)    |
| **NVLink Support**        | Yes (112 GB/s)                   | Yes (300 GB/s)                  | **V100** (better multi-GPU) |
| **Power Efficiency**      | 350W (consumer-grade)            | 250W (data-center optimized)   | **V100** (cooler, quieter) |

### **Critical Considerations for LLMs**
1. **VRAM is King**:
   - The **V100-32GB** has **33% more VRAM** (32GB vs. 24GB). This is crucial for:
     - Training larger models (e.g., GPT-3 requires >24GB).
     - Handling larger batch sizes.
     - Reducing gradient checkpointing overhead (slows training).
   - *If you work with models >7B parameters, the V100’s extra VRAM is a game-changer.*

2. **Performance per Dollar**:
   - The **V100** costs **half as much** but offers **~2.8x lower raw AI performance** than the RTX 3090.
   - However, for LLMs, **VRAM often bottlenecks performance more than raw TFLOPS**. A 3090 with 24GB might underfit large models, while a V100-32GB trains them smoothly.

3. **Tensor Core Efficiency**:
   - The RTX 3090’s newer Ampere Tensor Cores excel at **FP16/BF16** (critical for LLMs), but this only matters if your model fits in VRAM.
   - The V100’s Volta Tensor Cores are slower but **highly optimized for mixed-precision training** in data-center workloads.

4. **Multi-GPU Scaling**:
   - The V100’s **NVLink bandwidth is 3x higher** (300 GB/s vs. 112 GB/s). This matters for:
     - Distributed training (e.g., multi-node clusters).
     - Faster communication between GPUs.
   - If you plan to scale beyond 1 GPU, the V100 is superior.

5. **Software & Ecosystem**:
   - Both support CUDA, cuDNN, and PyTorch/TensorFlow.
   - The V100 is **data-center certified** (optimized for 24/7 workloads), while the 3090 is a consumer card (may throttle under sustained load).

---

### **Recommendation**
- **Choose the V100-32GB if**:
  - You work with **large models** (≥7B parameters) or need **>24GB VRAM**.
  - You’re on a **tight budget** (50% savings).
  - You plan **multi-GPU training** or prioritize reliability.
  - *Bottom line: The extra VRAM and lower cost outweigh the 3090’s raw performance for most LLM workloads.*

- **Choose the RTX 3090 if**:
  - You only train **small-to-medium models** (≤7B parameters) that fit in 24GB.
  - You need **single-GPU speed** and can’t afford multi-GPU setups.
  - You value **latest features** (e.g., BFloat16 acceleration).

---

### **Practical Example**
- **Training a 10B-parameter model**:
  - **RTX 3090**: Requires gradient checkpointing (slows training by ~30%) or model pruning.
  - **V100-32GB**: Fits entirely in VRAM, trains faster with full batch sizes.

- **Cost Efficiency**:
  - With the V100’s 50% savings, you could **buy two V100s for the price of one 3090**, gaining 64GB total VRAM and multi-GPU scaling.

---

### **Final Verdict**
**Go with the V100-32GB**. For LLMs, **VRAM and cost efficiency dominate** over raw TFLOPS. The extra 8GB of VRAM and 50% lower cost make it the smarter choice for most real-world LLM tasks, especially if you plan to scale or work with larger models. The RTX 3090’s speed advantage is irrelevant if your model doesn’t fit in memory.
