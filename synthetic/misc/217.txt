How can I randomly sort the output?

# Randomly Sort SQL Query Results

You can add `ORDER BY RANDOM()` to your query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY RANDOM();
```

## Database-Specific Alternatives

Different databases use different random functions:

- **SQLite, PostgreSQL**: `ORDER BY RANDOM()`
- **MySQL, MariaDB**: `ORDER BY RAND()`
- **SQL Server**: `ORDER BY NEWID()`
- **Oracle**: `ORDER BY DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE`

## Performance Note

⚠️ Random sorting can be slow on large tables since it needs to generate a random value for each row and then sort them all. If you only need a few random rows, consider using `LIMIT`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM train
WHERE project NOT LIKE '%biasbench%'
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 10;
```
