What is currently the best model on openrouter for coding is which also is free to use?
§a§
**MiMo-V2-Flash by Xiaomi** is currently the best free model on OpenRouter for coding tasks as of December 27, 2025.

### Why This Model?
- **Free Access**: It's available at $0 cost (with standard rate limits for free tier users) via OpenRouter's API, making it fully accessible without any paid credits or subscriptions.
- **Coding Performance**: This 309B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model excels in reasoning, code generation, debugging, and agentic coding workflows. It supports a 256K context window and a hybrid-thinking mode for complex tasks. It's specifically optimized for software engineering scenarios.
- **Benchmarks and Rankings**:
  - Ranks #1 among open-source models on SWE-bench Verified and SWE-bench Multilingual (key coding benchmarks for real-world software engineering tasks like bug fixing and code completion), outperforming models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 while being far more cost-efficient (about 3.5% of the cost).
  - In OpenRouter's overall LLM rankings, it's #2 by usage (395B tokens processed), indicating high popularity and reliability for practical use.
  - Outperforms competitors like Qwen3 235B-A22B in benchmarks such as AIME 2025 (math/coding reasoning), GPQA (general knowledge), and MMLU-Pro (multi-task language understanding, including coding elements). In Lamatic.ai benchmarks, it scores 66 overall (higher than KAT-Coder-Pro V1's 64) with strong metrics in speed (103 t/s) and efficiency.
- **Comparisons to Other Free Options**:
  | Model                  | Provider    | Key Strengths for Coding                  | Notable Benchmarks                  | Why Not the Best? |
  |------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
  | **MiMo-V2-Flash**     | Xiaomi     | Agentic coding, reasoning, long context  | #1 SWE-bench; outperforms Qwen3 in 3/3 key tests | N/A (top performer) |
  | Devstral 2 2512       | Mistral AI | High-performance code generation & agents| Strong in instruction-following; no specific SWE-bench #1 | Lacks top coding benchmark wins; lower usage rankings |
  | KAT-Coder-Pro V1      | KwaiPilot  | Agentic coding tasks, real-world dev     | Good for specialized agents; scores 64 on Lamatic | Lower benchmark scores (e.g., vs. MiMo's 66); less versatile |
  | Qwen3 235B-A22B       | Qwen       | Solid MoE for code & reasoning           | Competitive but trails MiMo in AIME/GPQA/MMLU-Pro | Older (mid-2025 release); not #1 on SWE-bench; lower recent rankings |
  | DeepSeek V3.1 Nex N1  | Nex AGI    | Derivative for code generation           | Decent for free tier; no top rankings | Variant of older DeepSeek; no longer fully free in base form; inferior to MiMo on benchmarks |

  MiMo edges out others due to its recent release (December 2025), superior coding-specific benchmarks, and high real-world usage on OpenRouter.

### How to Use It
- Access via OpenRouter's API (OpenAI-compatible): Sign up at openrouter.ai, get a free API key, and specify the model as `xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free`.
- Example Python code:
  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI
  client = OpenAI(
      base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      api_key="your_free_api_key_here",
  )
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python function to sort a list using quicksort."}]
  )
  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```
- Limitations: Free tier has rate limits (e.g., tokens per minute/day), but it's unlimited for basic use. For heavy workloads, monitor usage.

This recommendation is based on the latest available data from OpenRouter rankings, benchmarks, and community discussions as of December 27, 2025. Models can change, so check OpenRouter directly for updates.
