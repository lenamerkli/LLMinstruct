How many people participated in the largest opt-in EU class action lawsuit?
§a§
The largest opt-in EU class action lawsuit is widely considered to be the **German "Dieselgate" case** against Volkswagen, which had approximately **470,000 participants**.

While larger "opt-out" cases exist (such as the UK's Mastercard claim representing 46 million people), the German case required consumers to actively register their claims, making it the primary record-holder for an *opt-in* mechanism within the European Union.

### The Volkswagen "Dieselgate" Case (Germany)
The Federation of German Consumer Organisations (**vzbv**) filed this landmark case in 2018 under Germany's new "Model Declaratory Action" (*Musterfeststellungsklage*) law, which was created specifically to address mass consumer claims like the emissions scandal.

*   **Participation:** Approximately **470,000 consumers** actively registered for the lawsuit .
*   **Outcome:** In February 2020, vzbv and Volkswagen reached an out-of-court settlement worth €830 million. While ~470,000 registered, roughly **260,000** of those participants were deemed eligible and accepted the direct settlement offer, receiving payments between €1,350 and €6,257 each .
*   **Significance:** This case paved the way for the EU's Directive on Representative Actions, which now requires all member states to provide similar collective redress mechanisms .

### Comparison: The Mariana Dam Case (UK)
Although the UK is no longer part of the EU, the lawsuit regarding the **Mariana Dam disaster** in Brazil is often cited in the broader context of European group litigation because it dwarfs the German case in size.

*   **Participation:** Over **700,000 claimants** (including individuals, businesses, and municipalities) .
*   **Status:** As of 2024/2025, this case against BHP and Vale is proceeding in the English High Court and is described as the largest opt-in group action of its kind in the world .
*   **Distinction:** Because the UK left the EU, and the class size surged to its current record *after* Brexit (adding 500,000 claimants in 2023), the German Volkswagen case remains the technical record-holder for a lawsuit conducted under an **EU** member state's legal framework .
