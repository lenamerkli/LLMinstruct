Where in the Epstein Files can I find the email from Tuesday, July 09, 2009 12:21 PM with the Subject `RE: Epstein Update`?
§a§
The email you referenced, dated **Tuesday, July 9, 2019** at 12:21 PM (note: based on verification, this aligns with 2019 rather than 2009, as July 9, 2009, was a Thursday, not a Tuesday; this appears to be a common transcription error in queries about these documents) with the subject **RE: Epstein Update**, is part of the Jeffrey Epstein investigative files recently released by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

### Location in the Epstein Files
- **Document/File**: EFTA00037362.pdf
- **Dataset**: DataSet 8 (part of the broader Epstein files release in December 2025, stemming from the federal investigation into Epstein's activities).
- **Source**: Available via the DOJ's public Epstein files repository at .
- **Page/Context**: This is a standalone email exhibit in the PDF (likely a single-page file focused solely on the email chain). It discusses updates on locating and serving grand jury subpoenas to 10 co-conspirators in Epstein's case, as well as victim interviews and tip line activity following his July 2019 arrest.

Of the 10 co-conspirators, 3 have been located in FL and served GJ subpoenas; 1 in Boston, 1 in NYC, and 1 in CT were located and served. 4 of the 10 are outstanding with attempts having been made. 1 is a wealthy business man in Ohio, a lead is being sent to CV; the remaining 3 are currently out of pocket. The team (8 SAs/ITFOs, 2 AUSAs) is flying out tonight/tomorrow to various locations in Florida to interview approximately 25 victims. The 1-800-CALL-FBI line is up and running, we have received approximately 45 calls which we are in the process of vetting out. Let me know if you need anything else.

Good morning. A/SC Mi is requesting an update on the 10 co-conspirators by COB today. Can you tell us how many have successfully been located/interviewed/served with GJS? I believe the breakdown was 5 in New York, 1 in North Carolina, 1 in Boston, and 3 in Florida. Please let me know if you need anything from us. Thank you,

This email is part of the internal DOJ/FBI communications related to the 2019 Epstein investigation and does not appear in earlier unsealed documents from the 2015 *Giuffre v. Maxwell* civil case (which focused more on 2000s-era events). If this isn't the exact email you meant or if you have additional context (e.g., confirming the year), provide more details for further search.
